Subfigure labels are letters referring to individual subfigures within a larger figure.
Check if the caption contains explicit subfigure label. 
If not or there is only one subfigure, output "NO" and end the generation. 
If yes, output "YES", then generate the subcaption of the subfigures according to the caption. 
The output should use the template:
    YES
    Subfigure-A: ...
    Subfigure-B: ...
    ......
The label should be removed from subcaption.

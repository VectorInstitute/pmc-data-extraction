The Dll-expressing nuclei (arrow) have become highly polyploid.(C and D) At stage 12, only the original bacteriocyte nuclei are observed expressing Dll (white arrow), but by stage 14 (D) additional nuclei (blue arrow) closely apposed to the dorsal germband express Dll.(E) By stage 15, these new nuclei surround the original bacteriocyte, and at later stages the bacteria are divided into individual cells.\n",

      " Bacteriocytes Are Retained in One Species That Has Evolutionarily Lost Bacteria, but Not in Males of Another Species That Do Not Inherit Bacteria(A and B) Confocal micrographs of embryos of T. styraci stained with anti-Dll antibody (red). In T. styraci, in which B. aphidicola has been evolutionarily lost (Fukatsu and Ishikawa 1992a), embryos still contain nuclei that express Dll in the correct time and place to be bacteriocyte nuclei. (A) Dll expression is first detected in posterior nuclei at blastoderm at approximately stage 6 (arrow). (B) By stage 14, the original nuclei have divided once or twice and become polyploid (original bacteriocytes), and new cells begin to express Dll (new bacteriocytes; blue arrow) and migrate towards the original bacteriocytes.(C–F) Confocal micrographs of embryos of P. spyrothecae stained with anti-Dll antibody (red). (C) Stage 16 male embryos of P. spyrothecae do not contain B. aphidicola, and no Dll-expressing cells are observed in the expected location for bacteriocytes. We believe that the cells in this location are sperm (marked with an asterisk). Sexual female embryos within the same ovary do contain Dll-expressing original and new bacteriocyte nuclei (white and blue arrows, respectively). (D and E) Transient expression of Dll in putative bacteriocytes is observed in stage 7 male embryos (arrow in male embryo of [D]), but this expression does not persist into stage 10 male embryos (E), where no Dll-expressing nuclei are observed. By contrast, stage 6 female embryos (D) contain polyploid Dll-expressing nuclei (arrow in female embryo of [D]). The sex of each embryo could be determined because males develop synchronously and earlier than females (Lampel 1958, 1968). (F) In stage 14 male embryos, we observe transient Dll expression in nuclei (blue arrow) adjacent to the germ cells (gc) in the correct location to be the second wave of bacteriocyte nuclei. This Dll expression does not persist (see stage 16 male in [C]), and the fate of the cells is unknown.\n",

      " Biochemistry and Histology of Different Skin Types(A) Activation of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) promotes the synthesis of eumelanin at the expense of pheomelanin, although oxidation of tyrosine by tyrosinase (TYR) is required for synthesis of both pigment types. The membrane-associated transport protein (MATP) and the pink-eyed dilution protein (P) are melanosomal membrane components that contribute to the extent of pigment synthesis within melanosomes. (B) There is a gradient of melanosome size and number in dark, intermediate, and light skin; in addition, melanosomes of dark skin are more widely dispersed.

      " Using Expression Data to Identify and Refine Sequence-Based Functional Assignments(A) Starting from a set of coexpressed genes (yellow dots in left box) associated with a particular function in organism A, we first identify the homologues in organism B using BLAST (middle box). Only some of these homologues are coexpressed while others are not (blue dots). The signature algorithm selects this coexpressed subset and adds further genes (light yellow) that were not identified based on sequence, but share similar expression profiles (right box).(B) The 15 coexpressed genes associated with heat shock in yeast (center) have eight homologues in E. coli (left) and 14 in C. elegans (right). Among the ten genes whose expression profiles are the most similar to these homologues (bottom), many are known to be associated with heat-shock response (boldface).(C) For each of the six organisms, the distribution of the Z-scores for the average gene–gene correlation of all the “homologue modules” (see Materials and Methods) obtained from the yeast modules is shown (top). Rejecting the homologues that are not coexpressed gives rise to the “purified modules,” whose Z-scores generally are larger (except for the yeast modules, which contain only coexpressed genes from the beginning). Adding further coexpressed genes yields the “refined modules,” which have significantly larger Z-scores (bottom).\n",

      " Regulatory Relations between ModulesA selection of eight transcription modules whose function is known in yeast was used to generate the corresponding (refined) homologue modules in the other five organisms. Each module is associated with a “condition profile” generated by the signature algorithm based on the expression data.(A) Correlations between these profiles were calculated for all pairs of modules in each organism. Note that for E. coli there is no proteasome and that the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) correspond to ribosomal genes. Modules are represented by circles (legend). Significantly correlated or significantly anticorrelated modules are connected by colored lines indicating their correlation (color bar). Positively correlated modules are placed close to each other, while a large distance reflects anticorrelation. See Figure S11 for a numerical tabulation of all pairwise correlations.(B and C) Correlations between pairs of modules according to the cell-cycle data as a function their correlation in the full data. Each circle corresponds to a pair of S. cerevisiae modules (B) or human modules (C).(D) To check the sensitivity of our results with respect to the size of the dataset, we reevaluated the correlations between the sets of conditions for randomly selected subsets of the data.

The distributions of Agouti mRNA and histochemical staining for melanocytes are both affected by Tbx15 and are externally evident by a widening of the lateral stripe and an increased proportion of total skin occupied by the cream-colored area.(B) The lateral yellow stripe in at/at mice lies at the same level as the limb dorsoventral boundary. As described in the text, we propose that distinct dorsoventral compartments in ectoderm of the trunk provide an instructional cue to the mesoderm, leading to expression of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme and acquisition of dorsal dermis character. In the absence of Tbx15, dorsal mesenchyme assumes ventral characteristics instead.\n",

Animal order and time as in Figure 3B. Color bar in linear scale.(C) Neuronal ensemble correlations sorted by state for rat 5 CX. In comparison with WK, there is a clear increase in the contrast between pre- and postnovelty correlations during SW sleep. In this particular animal and brain area, increased correlations were also seen for REM sleep, but this was not the case in other animals (A). Furthermore, this REM effect was substantially weakened when expressed in p values (B), due to the very short duration of REM sleep episodes. In this respect, notice that REM sleep has much fewer datapoints, reflecting the short duration of this state relative to WK and SW sleep. Thus, even in a site where REM sleep showed results similar to SW sleep, the cumulative neuronal reverberation that takes place during REM is necessarily less than that of SW.(D) Statistical comparison of matches between templates of neuronal activity sampled at WK normal speed with a range of targets spanning different temporal scales. Plotted are Bonferroni comparison p values for post- and prenovelty comparisons in all animals according to behavioral state and brain area, calculated in intervals of 4 h for speed factors ranging from 20 times faster to two times slower than the WK normal rate. No evidence for optimization at speeds different from the WK physiological rate (1×) was found. Color scale as in (B).\n",

      " Neuronal Reverberation Is Strongest during SW Sleep(A) Rat 5 (CX) dramatically illustrates the state dependency of neuronal ensemble correlations, which are strongly increased by SW sleep but readily decreased by WK. The upper panel shows the firing rates of 38 cortical neurons for approximately 45 h after exposure to novel stimulation (indicated by an asterisk). The middle panel shows the superimposition of successive neuronal ensemble correlations and concurrent behavioral states. Nearly all correlation peaks correspond to SW episodes, while almost all troughs match WK epochs. The lower panel represents pooled LFP forebrain coherence (Amjad et al. 1997) over time, useful to discriminate between WK (strong coherence above 25 Hz and weak coherence under 5 Hz) and SW sleep (the opposite). Notice that in this particular example (rat 5, CX), REM episodes show correlations similar to those of SW sleep, but, as shown in Figure 4, this was the exception and not the rule across several animals.(B) State-dependent neuronal reverberation was sustained throughout the recording period, as shown by segments representing the beginning (3,200–3,300 min), middle (4,700–4,800 min), and end (5,200–5,250 min) of the experimental record. In the upper panel, notice the progressive increase of neuronal correlations across single SW sleep episodes.(C) Blow-up of two selected data segments indicated by asterisks in (A). Despite having being sampled from moments of high neuronal firing rates (asterisk), novel stimulation templates reverberate most strongly during SW sleep when firing rates are low (single asterisk and double asterisks). The high firing rates that characterize WK correspond to decreased neuronal reverberation, probably due to sensory interference.\n",

The chromosomes are fully condensed at timepoint 121 min.(B–D) The two centriole pairs (green) projected over the phase-contrast view (grey) can be seen close to the fenestrated NE and away from the plasma membrane (pm) in control cells (B), while they remain plasma membrane-bound in asp (C) and in colcemid-treated wild-type cells (D). In asp spermatocytes (C), the position of the membrane-bound centrioles correlates tightly with the pointed end of phase-dark protrusions (arrows) that are not present in colcemid-treated cells. These reflect the distribution of phase-contrast membranes known to overlap microtubules in these cells.(E–J) XY projections (E–G) and their corresponding optical sections (H–J) of control (E and H), asp (F and I), colcemid-treated spermatocytes (G and J) expressing an endogenous GFP–α-tubulin confirm that the two major MTOCs in control cells are close to the nucleus, but remain near the plasma membrane in the two experimental conditions. MTOC activity in colcemid-treated spermatocytes was assayed following a 1-s pulse of 350 nm light to inactivate the drug, thus allowing microtubule regrowth.

Hemotoxylin and eosin staining shows acini of the normal lactating gland are composed of a single layer of secretory epithelial cells (A) with milk-filled lumen. Consistent with atrophy, transgenic animals have a lower density of acini demonstrated by the presence of lipid-filled adipocytes (asterisk in [K]). Acini composed of T121-expressing cells are atypical. Many are collapsed and composed of tall columnar epithelia of large hyperchromatic cells with papillary tufting (arrows in [I]). Transgene-expressing cells have large pleomorphic nuclei (open arrows in [G]) as compared to nuclei of nonexpressing cells (arrows in [G]). Staining for T121 expression (blue in [B]–[J]) indicates the line 2 F0 animal is mosaic, showing localized expression (F), whereas the transgene expresses throughout the gland of an F1 line 3 animal (J). Increased proliferation assayed by PCNA staining (red) is also localized in the mosaic founder (G), but found throughout the F1 transgenic gland (K). Similarly, TUNEL staining (brown) demonstrates increased apoptosis in transgenic animals (H and L); moreover, the regionalized apoptosis in the mosaic gland (H) strongly suggests that transgene expression and not precocious involution is the cause.

      " Biosynthesis of Acetate-Primed Polyketides(A) Minimal PKS is necessary and sufficient for the synthesis of a complete polyketide chain. KS-CLF is the condensing enzyme in the minimal PKS, catalyzing each round of condensation between malonyl-ACP and the growing polyketide chain. ACP serves as the carrier for malonyl units, and it is malonylated by the MAT associated with FAS. Chain synthesis initiates with the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP by the KS-CLF for most aromatic PKSs. The acetyl unit is then transferred to the KS-CLF and primes the enzyme for subsequent condensations. The overall chain length is controlled by the KS-CLF complex. An octaketide synthase (e.g., act PKS) uses a total of eight malonyl equivalents (including the primer), while a decaketide synthase (e.g., tcm PKS) uses a total of ten malonyl equivalents.(B) An octaketide can spontaneously form SEK4 and SEK4b in the absence of tailoring enzymes. Members of the act KR family can regioselectively reduce the octaketide at C-9, which can then spontaneously form mutactin in the absence of AROs and CYCs. When bifunctional ARO/CYC (e.g., actVII) and second-ring CYC (e.g., actIV) are present, the reduced octaketide can be transformed into the anthraquinone DMAC.(C) A decaketide can spontaneously form SEK15 and SEK15b in the absence of tailoring enzymes. KR can regioselectively reduce the C-9 carbonyl. A reduced decaketide can spontaneously form RM20, RM20b, and RM20c. Not shown are the other tailoring enzymes associated with decaketides, which can transform the nascent decaketide into tetracycline or anthracycline structures.\n",

CH999/pYT45, which contains the R1128 loading module and an incomplete minimal PKS, produced no major polyketides. (Right) Upon coexpressing the R1128 loading module with a functional act minimal PKS (in the presence of KR), two new major polyketides were produced with the indicated masses. When 1 g/l of valine was added to the growth medium, the yield of the compound with mass of 292 doubled (traces not drawn to the same scale). The two compounds are identified as YT46 and YT46b.(B) Engineered biosynthesis of YT46 and YT46b. YT46 (1) is derived from propionate, while YT46b (2) is derived from isobutyrate. Alkylacyl-ZhuG supplied by the loading module is able to prime the act minimal PKS efficiently. Incorporation of the alkylacyl moiety by the KS-CLF led to a decrease in the number of extender units incorporated in the final chain.

Condensation of the two units by the ketosynthase, with loss of one carbon from malonyl-CoA as carbon dioxide, produces a four-carbon chain attached to the ACP. This is transferred back to the ketosynthase, and further rounds of condensation with malonyl-CoA (as shown) or other chain extender units produce a polyketide chain.(B) The three-step reductive cycle that converts a keto group to a hydroxyl, then to a double bond, and finally to a fully saturated carbon.(C) A complex polyketide in which keto groups, hydroxyl groups, double bonds, and fully saturated carbons occur at different positions along the chain, depending on the operation of the reductive cycle after each condensation.\n",

      " The Chemotaxis Pathways in E. coli and B. subtilis\n",
      "(A) E. coli. (B) B. subtilis. Both organisms respond to extracellular signals by regulating the activity of the CheA histidine kinase. CheA is coupled to transmembrane receptors (MCP) by an adaptor protein CheW. Chemoattractants, by binding the receptor, inhibit CheA in E. coli (red line) (Borkovich et al. 1989) and stimulate CheA in B. subtilis (green line) (Garrity and Ordal 1997). CheA phosphorylates CheY. Phosphorylated CheY binds to the flagellar motor and increases the frequency of tumbles in E. coli (Cluzel et al. 2000) and runs in B. subtilis (Bischoff et al. 1993). Phosphorylated CheY is also predicted to inhibit the receptor complex in B. subtilis (dashed line). Both organisms tune the sensitivity of CheA to ligands by reversibly methylating the receptors using the CheR methytransferase and CheB methylesterase (Zimmer et al. 2000; Sourjik and Berg 2002b). Phosphorylation of CheB by CheA increases its methylesterase activity nearly 100-fold (Anand and Stock 2002). CheA activity is proportional to the degree of receptor methylation in E. coli. In B. subtilis, CheA activity depends on which residue is methylated, akin to a binary switch. E. coli possesses a phosphatase, CheZ, not present in B. subtilis, that enhances the rate of CheY dephosphorylation. B. subtilis possesses three chemotaxis proteins not found in E. coli: CheC, CheD, and CheV. CheC is a negative regulator of receptor methylation and homologous to the CheY-binding domain (P2) in CheA (Rosario et al. 1995; Rosario and Ordal 1996). CheD is a positive regulator of receptor methylation and also deamidates specific residues on the receptor (Kristich and Ordal 2002). CheV is a CheW-response regulator fusion. CheV is functionally redundant to CheW and is predicted to negatively regulate receptor activity (dashed line) (Rosario et al. 1994; Karatan et al. 2001).\n",

The system reaches steady state only when the two solid lines cross. As the rate of methylation decreases monotonically with receptor activity and the rate of demethylation increases monotonically with receptor activity, only one steady state is possible (A*) if the rates depend solely on receptor activity. The kinetic parameters change the slope of the curves, but not their monotonicity. Hence, adaptation is robust with respect to changes in the kinetic parameters. However, the point where they intersect does change with the parameters.(B) Qualitative relationship between receptor activity and the differential rate of methylation in B. subtilis. The net rate of methylation at residue 630 decreases monotonically with receptor activity, and the net rate of methylation at residue 637 increases monotonically with receptor activity. By the same arguments, only one steady state (A*) is possible and, hence, adaptation is robust in B. subtilis.\n",

      " Funding Healthcare R&D(A) A schematic of the way the public currently funds healthcare R&D. Academic research funded by government research agencies is paid for via taxes. This is a mixture of pure research into fundamentals and directed research, including clinical trials. Despite this, there is a dogma that academic R&D cannot produce drugs since it does not have the required commercial pressures to turn ideas into products. Patents ensure the public pays for commercial R&D via their purchase of medicines at high prices, compared to those of generic copies. The distortion of research priorities (too much spent on ‘me too’ drugs and too little on neglected diseases) has been recognised by governments for some time, and a variety of push-and-pull mechanisms have been introduced (or are being considered) to encourage research that more closely reflects public priorities. Examples of push incentives are tax breaks for R&D and other incentives such as special marketing monopolies for products as a reward for investing in research on orphan drugs or testing with pediatric patients. Pull incentives currently being discussed are advance-purchase commitments, with which governments guarantee to buy a certain amount of a drug if one is developed, or prize models. Some of these schemes are thought to be inefficient, particularly those that are indiscriminate and provide expensive subsidies relative to the amount of new R&D they ‘encourage’.(B) A schematic of the way funding of healthcare R&D could work if separate competitive markets for sales and R&D were created. A crucial difference is the absence of monopolies on final products, enabling competition between generic producers and greatly reduced prices. Incentives to develop new drugs would be provided by a new virtual market in R&D. ‘Nationally directed R&D funds’ could represent anything from rewards for innovation using market based mechanisms such as prize models (see text) to centralised funding agencies, similar to the NIH model, or multiple R&D investment funding bodies that compete for new resources. Contributions to R&D could be via taxation or as a legal obligation when paying for private healthcare plans (see text). The ability to design what would be rewarded in the virtual market would allow governments to set R&D priorities and build up local capacity within their own countries. Countries could choose weaker patent protection and create an environment in which all research groups could build on each other's work.\n",

Migrating cells were labeled with stem cell markers and analyzed by FACS to determine the actual frequency of migrated HSCs. Like adult BM HSCs, FL HSCs migrate in response to SDF-1α (A), although at reduced levels. The optimal concentration of SDF-1α for both fetal liver and adult BM HSCs was determined to be 10 nM. The migratory effect of SLF was also assayed on FL HSCs and adult BM HSCs. FL HSCs migrate equally well to SLF as SDF-1α, while adult BM HSCs showed a lesser response to SLF. SLF and SDF-1α acted synergistically in their chemoattractive effects on FL HSCs (B). To determine whether migration was due to chemokinetic effects of SDF-1α, SLF, or both, equal concentrations of factors were added to both the top and bottom wells (T&B). Data are presented as the percentage of input HSCs that migrate to the bottom chamber for a representative migration assay, each point was performed in triplicate.

Arp2/3 was mixed with 6 μM γ-32P-AzidoATP and exposed to UV either before (closed circle) or after (open circle) the addition of excess (2 mM) unlabeled ATP.

(i) Arp2 and Arp3 are separated when the Arp2/3 complex is free in solution. (ii) Upon pointed-end capping, the binding energy of the actin-Arp2/3 interface drives Arp2 and Arp3 together and (iii) a conformational change on Arp2 (shown by the red the subdomain 3/4 loop flipping out) triggers ATP hydrolysis by Arp2 (filament pointed-end capping is probably not a significant function of the Arp2/3 complex in vivo).(b) A VCA-bound actin monomer drives the activation of the Arp2/3 complex and stimulates ATP hydrolysis on Arp2. (i) The Arp2/3 complex must first be bound to the side of an actin filament, and an actin monomer is bound to the VC domain of the WASP-family protein. (ii) The VC domain of the WASP-family protein docks the first monomer of the daughter filament onto the Arp2/3 complex, stabilizing the Arp2–Arp3–actin interaction and promoting the active conformation of the complex. (cf. Aii). (iii) The active conformation of the Arp2–Arp3–actin monomer triggers a conformational change on Arp2 and ATP hydrolysis by the subunit. (iv) Actin polymerizes from the activated Arp2/3 complex. ATP hydrolysis by Arp2 may promote dissociation of the CA domain of the WASP-family protein from the Arp2/3 complex, aided by actin polymerization, which competes its WH2 domain from the first actin monomer.\n",

The x-axis represents time (in seconds) with the yellow arrow and R marking the point in time of the solution button-press response (i.e., 0.0 s). The green horizontal bars above the x-axis represent the time intervals used in the statistical analyses and topographic maps. Note that gamma-band power for insight trials (red line) starts to increase above power on noninsight trials (blue line) by approximately 0.3 s before the button press.(B) Time-frequency plots of the insight minus noninsight difference shown in (A). The y-axis represents frequency (in Hz); the x-axis represents time (in seconds, with respect to the button press, exactly as shown in [A]). Red areas of the plot reflect times and frequencies at which insight EEG power is greater than noninsight EEG power; blue areas reflect times and frequencies at which noninsight EEG power is greater than insight EEG power. Note the sudden emergence of increased gamma power for insight solutions approximately 0.3 s before the button press.(C) Insight minus noninsight gamma-band differences plotted as topographic maps (LH and RH) of scalp current density (in v2/m2) estimated by a spline-based Laplacian transform computed with a realistic FMRI-derived head model. The Laplacian transform acts as a high-pass spatial filter that minimizes the contribution of activity distant from each electrode, thereby manifesting discrete, relatively superficial sources. The maps are thresholded to show foci of current density at the upper and lower 20% of the scale. Note the prominent effect of insight (effect for insight greater than effect for noninsight, in red) at the right superior temporal electrode (T8) and surrounding electrodes present from −0.30 to −0.02 s (measured with respect to the solution response) that is not present in the earlier epoch (−1.52 to −0.36 s).

      "(A) cfk encodes a sarcomeric actin highly homologous to zebrafish α-cardiac and α-skeletal actins. Cfk differs from zebrafish α-cardiac actin at six residues and from zebrafish α-skeletal actin at four residues, but from zebrafish β-actin at 28 residues. Residues in red are those that differ from Cfk. Dots above the sequence indicate residues that universally distinguish sarcomeric from cytoplasmic actins. The arrow at R177 indicates the location of histidine in Cfks11.(B) The arginine at position 177 is universally conserved in all actin proteins examined.(C and D) cfk is expressed in the myocardium during development. In (C), whole-mount in situ hybridization on a cmlc2::GFP embryo at 36 hpf shows that cfk is expressed throughout the AP extent of the heart tube. Blue staining indicates areas of cfk expression; green is the region of cmlc2 expression. The red arrow indicates the heart tube. In (D), a plastic section of stained embryo shows cfk expression in the myocardium of the heart (blue arrow), but not in the endocardial cells (red arrow). From the onset of its expression in the heart region (around the 16-somite stage), cfk does not appear to be expressed in endothelial and endocardial cells. Weak cfk expression is also seen in the somites (data not shown).\n",

Approximately half of the embryos with defective myocardial function at 36 hpf did not develop endocardial rings. All embryos with a lack of endocardial rings previously demonstrated a myocardial function phenotype at 36 hpf. Further analyses including the genotyping of a subset of embryos showed that a small percentage of cfk−/− embryos were unaffected at 36 hpf and that they subsequently developed ECs.(B) Embryos treated from 24 to 48 hpf with 2,3-BDM to decrease myocardial force failed to develop endocardial rings in a dose-dependent manner.

The probability is highly significant (p < 0.0001), confirming that the spatial organization of PID species richness on the largest scale matches the nested species subset hierarchy illustrated in Figure 1A.

(2) As the two species independently diverge, one becomes fixed for allele X at the first locus and the other for allele A at the second locus. (3) HI is caused by the interaction between these derived alleles, X and A. (4) This interaction may cause misregulation of downstream effector genes (d1, d2, and d3), which in turn causes the HI phenotype.(B) Hmr is an HI gene. Hmrmel has evolved in the D. melanogaster lineage and interacts to cause HI with Asib, an allele of a hypothesized autosomal gene that has evolved in the sibling-species lineage. Mutations in Hmrmel allow hybrid viability by eliminating the activity of this incompatibility allele.(C) Hmr is a downstream effector gene. Here, two unknown genes cause HI by misregulating Hmr. Mutations in Hmr allow hybrid viability by acting as downstream suppressors of the HI alleles.(D) Model with Hmr and gene A extensively diverging (see Discussion). Both Hmr and gene A coevolve with many changes along both lineages. HI could be caused by interactions between derived alleles or between a derived and an ancestral allele.

According to Sample and Kieff (1990), the level of transcription along the EBNA genes region decreases from left to right (I–III). Intermediate levels of transcription were also reported for the two hatched regions. However, these regions contain either repeated sequences (the terminal repeats) or cross-hybridize with other transcribed regions (oriLytR and oriLytL); therefore, their actual level of transcription could be lower.\n",

      " Duplication Speed of Various Segments of the Raji EBV Genome(A) A detailed procedure to calculate Td using SMARD was published elsewhere (Norio and Schildkraut 2001). Here we describe how to calculate Tdab for a generic genomic region (a)–(b) (i.e., any portion of the EBV genome) using information derived from the replication patterns of a longer region (A)–(B) (i.e., the whole EBV genome). Depicted are the hypothetical staining patterns for 32 DNA molecules representing the genomic region (A)–(B) after double-labeling with two halogenated nucleotides (red and green). The molecules that started and completed their duplication during the first labeling period are fully red (R). The molecules that started their duplication during the first labeling period, completing it during the second labeling period are stained in both red and green (RG). In the total population of molecules, the fraction of R molecules increases when the length of the first labeling period (Tp1) increases. The fraction of RG molecules is proportional to the time required to duplicate the genomic region (A)–(B). Some of these molecules (marked rg) are stained in red and green also within the region (a)–(b). The fraction of rg molecules is proportional to the time required to duplicate the genomic region (a)–(b). This relationship is expressed by the equation reported at the bottom of the figure and allows us to calculate Tdab using parameters that can be easily measured on individual DNA molecules (NR, the number of R molecules; NRG, the number of RG molecules; Nrg, the number of rg molecules). Finally, the ratio between the size of the genomic segments analyzed (Lab) and Tdab represents the duplication speed of the segment (Sdab). The results obtained from the PacI and the SwaI experiments are reported in (B) and (C). Double-headed arrows indicate the genomic segments analyzed quantitatively. Segments marked with the same letter in the two maps correspond to identical portions of the Raji EBV genome. Above each arrow is indicated the corresponding Sd value in kilobases per minute. The sizes of these segments are as follows: A–G, 25 kb; H, 20 kb; I, 35 kb; K, 10 kb; L, 75 kb; and J, 10 kb. A comparison of the values obtained from the two experiments shows remarkable similarities. The largest variation was found for segment G. However, in both experiments this segment was located at the end of the DNA molecules. Therefore, the variability in stretching in this portion of the molecules may have affected the collection of the data. The red dashed line below the map indicates the position of the RRF.\n",

Positions of molecular size markers are shown on the left.(B) Disulfide bond formation efficiency. For each residue pair, the radioactivity of the αβ heterodimer band divided by the total radioactivity (sum of α, β, and αβ bands) was used to calculate the disulfide bond formation efficiency and is depicted by a gray scale (white for 0% to black for 100% efficiency). The upper and lower halves of the circle indicate the efficiency before (constitutive) and after (oxidized) Cu-phenanthroline treatment at 0 °C, respectively. Residue pairs that form inducible disulfides (i.e., efficiency increases more than 10% after oxidation) are denoted by asterisks. Results are the mean of at least two independent experiments. Solid line shows the predicted TM boundary; dotted line indicates boundary between residues that form constitutive and inducible disulfide bonds.(C) Relative orientation of the αIIb and β3 TM helices near their N-terminal ends. The TM domains are depicted schematically as α helices, and experimental results from cysteine scanning were used to deduce their relative orientation. The resultant schematic model is shown in both top and side views. Residue pairs that form disulfide bonds at greater than 50% efficiency are connected by solid (constitutive disulfides) or dotted (inducible disulfides) red lines. The gray dotted line represents the boundary between residues that form constitutive and inducible disulfide bonds. Residues are color coded based on the number of constitutive or inducible disulfide bonds formed at greater than 50% efficiency: multiple bonds (interacting residues, red), only one bond (peripheral residues, pink), and no bonds (outside residues, blue).(D) Homodimer formation by the W967C mutant of αIIb. Transfection, radiolabeling, and immunoprecipitation was performed as in (A). Full-length αIIb with the W967C mutation (α-W967C) but not the truncated active mutant αIIb with W697C (α*-W967C) produced a homodimer band (α–α) larger than the heterodimer band (α–β).

The longitudinal filaments are collectively referred to as the “central element” of the SC. Ellipsoidal structures called recombination nodules (gray ellipsoid) are constructed on the central region of the SC. As their name implies, recombination nodules are believed to be involved in facilitating meiotic recombination (crossing over). The chromatin (red loops) of each homologue is attached to its corresponding lateral element. Because there are two “sister chromatids” in each homologue, two loops are shown extending laterally from each point along a lateral element.(B) Top: Set of tomato SCs. Chromatin “sheaths” are visible around each SC. Bottom: Two tomato SCs. The chromatin has been stripped from the SCs, allowing the details of the SC to be observed.

The ssDNA consists of 20-base noncoding regions (black lines Z1–Z4) and 20-base coding positions (colored bars [a,b,c]1–3). All library members contain the same four DNA sequences at the four noncoding regions. At each of the three coding positions, three mutually exclusive codons, (a,b,c)n, are present for a total of twenty-seven different routing genes. Resin beads coated with an oligonucleotide complementary to one codon (anticodon beads; gray ball at left) capture by hybridization ssDNAs containing the corresponding codon.(B) To travel through the network, the ssDNA library starts on one or multiple DEAE columns (black column on left) and is hybridized to a set of anticodon columns (red, green, and blue columns) corresponding to the set of codons in the first coding position. The genes are thus physically partitioned into subpools based on sequence identity and can be processed accordingly. Each subpool is subsequently transferred to a distinct DEAE column, completing the first step through the network. The hybridization splitting, processing, and transfer are repeated for all subsequent coding regions. After completion of the final step, the library is concentrated on a reverse-phase column (RP; black-and-white column on right) and eluted for solution manipulation.\n",

      " Construction and Diversification of Routing Gene Populations(A) Overlapping complementary oligonucleotides that span an entire gene (for example [Z–a]1–8 and a1–8′–Z2–9′) were assembled into full gene products (“all a,” “all b,” etc.) by primerless PCR and subcloned. Equivalent amounts of the ten resulting plasmids (a1–8, … , j1–8) were mixed and used as template for eight separate PCR reactions with noncoding region primer pairs (Zi/Zi\n",

      "+1) were assembled into a library of 108 different genes by primerless PCR (right).(B) To generate ssDNA, a T7 promoter (pT7) was appended to the 3′ end of the double strand DNA library. The minus strand of the library was transcribed using T7 RNA Polymerase (T7 RNAP), and reverse transcribed from a Z1 primer using MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV RT) in a coupled reaction. The resulting DNA/RNA heteroduplex was treated with sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the RNA, providing ssDNA.\n",

      " Chemical Translation(A) Schematic showing the structure of the DNA support library. Small molecules are synthesized at the 5′ end of 340-base ssDNA genes. The ssDNA consists of 20-base noncoding regions (black lines labeled Z1–Z7) and 20-base coding positions (colored bars labeled [a–j]1–6). All library members contain the same seven DNA sequences at the seven noncoding regions. At each of the six coding positions, ten mutually exclusive DNA codons, (a–j)n, are present, for a total of 60 different sequences. Each coding region specifies the addition of a single subunit to a growing small molecule. A unique reactive site (in this case a primary amine) for small-molecule synthesis is attached to the 5′ end of the ssDNA through a polyethylene glycol linker (squiggly line). Resin beads coated with an oligonucleotide complementary to one codon (anticodon beads, gray ball at right) capture by hybridization ssDNAs containing the corresponding codon.(B) Chemical translation is a split-and-pool synthesis, with splitting directed by DNA hybridization. A ssDNA library is hybridized to a set of anticodon columns (gray balls) corresponding to the set of codons present at a single coding position. The ssDNA genes partition into subpools based on sequence identity. Distinct chemical subunits (colored balls) are coupled to the DNA in each subpool. Finally, the DNA is repooled, completing the encoded addition of one subunit to the growing small molecule. The process of hybridization splitting, chemistry, and pooling is repeated for all subsequent coding regions.(C) Schematic product of chemical translation. The sequence of the small-molecule subunits (colored balls) corresponds to the sequence of codons (colored bars) in the ssDNA gene.\n",

      " A Schematic of the Proposed Relationships of the Novel Immune Regulators, Sick and Dnr1, to Dredd and RelPointed and blunt arrows indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Both Sick and Dredd are required for translocation of Rel to the nucleus and for activation of Dipt expression and they are consequently positioned upstream of Rel as activators. In the absence of Sick or Dredd, Dnr1 function is not needed to maintain pathway quiescence. Thus, Dnr1 is ordinarily required to either inhibit Sick and Dredd functions or to negate their actions, and we have indicated these regulators as being downstream of Dnr1 (A). Although we have no epistatic data that separates the action of Sick and Dredd, Dredd appears to directly cleave Rel and is hence likely to be immediately upstream of Rel. Sick might function in conjunction with Dredd or as an activator of Dredd. Since dnr1 RNAi does not enhance the response to LPS, we suggest that its inhibitor activity is either repressed or bypassed upon exposure to LPS. Consequently, we have shown that treatment with LPS counteracts Dnr1-dependent Dredd inhibition (B). We do not mean to preclude other actions of LPS that might contribute to induction, but it is notable that inactivation of Dnr1 is sufficient to activate signaling. Finally, we have shown that Dnr1 levels are affected by Dredd, and we have indicated this with a positive feedback arrow.\n",

      " Virulence Evolution in Mouse Malaria during Serial Passage in Immunized Versus Naïve MiceVirulence was measured by minimum red blood cell density (y-axis) in lines of P. chabaudi before (“ancestral lines;”black and gray symbols) and after serial passage through immunized (“I-lines;” red lines and triangles) or naïve (“N-lines,” green lines and circles) mice before (A) and after (B) mosquito transmission. Evolved and ancestral lines were compared in both naïve (solid lines) and immunized mice (broken lines). Filled symbols, before mosquito transmission; open symbols, after mosquito transmission. Lines were selected from an avirulent, “unadapted” clone (CW-0; left set of lines) and a virulent, “preadapted” ancestral population (CW-A; right): the latter was derived from the former by 12 serial passages in a previous experiment (Mackinnon and Read 1999b). Each symbol (with ± 1 standard error based on the variance between subline means) represents the mean of mice infected with an ancestral line or a set of passaged lines (i.e., five sublines, two mice per subline). Prior to mosquito transmission (A), differences between the I-lines and N-lines were significant in three out of the four cases (p < 0.05 for lines from the unadapted line infecting naïve mice, p < 0.01 for unadapted infecting immunized, and p < 0.001 for preadapted infecting immunized): in the fourth case (p > 0.1 for preadapted infecting naïve), virulence of the ancestral line was already apparently near-maximal. After mosquito transmission (B), the differences between the I-lines and N-lines remained the same in naïve mice as before transmission (interaction between the mosquito transmission effect and the I-line-versus-N-line difference was p > 0.7 in both the unadapted and preadapted cases). However, these line differences were eliminated in immunized mice (interaction term: p = 0.02 for the unadapted case, p = 0.08 for the preadapted case). Mosquito transmission significantly reduced the virulence of the preadapted ancestral line in immunized mice (p = 0.03) but not in the other ancestral-line-by-immune-treatment combinations (p > 0.2 in these cases). In the selection lines, mosquito transmission significantly reduced the virulence in five out of the eight comparisons (p = 0.009 and p = 0.13 in the N-lines in naïve mice derived from CW-0 and CW-A, respectively, with values of p = 0.55 and p = 0.005 in N-lines in immunized mice, p = 0.022 and p = 0.26 in I-lines in naïve mice, and p = 0.006 and p < 0.0001 in I-lines in immunized mice). Ancestral pretransmission lines had similar levels of virulence in the separate pretransmission and posttransmission experiments, with the exception of the preadapted ancestral line in immunized mice, which had higher virulence in the latter than the former (p = 0.002). Similar results to the above were obtained when virulence was measured by maximum weight loss (unpublished data). No deaths occurred during the pretransmission experiments, but in addition to the one death that occurred early in the infection prior to the occurrence of any weight loss or anemia (excluded from analyses), five occurred in the posttransmission experiment, four of these in naïve mice (two in the N-lines, one in the I-lines, and one in the nontransmitted ancestral line, all derived from the preadapted line) and one in an immunized mouse (preadapted, nontransmitted ancestral line).\n",

Intensity plots for the regions in these images marked by dotted circles are shown in the lower panel. The top panel shows a schematic representation of these different stages.(C) Schematic fluorescence intensity plots for lysosomes undergoing partial (red) or complete (green) fusion. Owing to the exponential decay of the evanescent field (blue; top panels in [A] and [B]) away from the coverslip, a lysosome that is more than 150 nm from the cell membrane (black line in top panels in [A] and [B]) is not fluorescent. As this lysosome moves closer (labeled as “entry into evanescent field”), its fluorescence intensity increases. Since the lumen of lysosome is acidic, it quenches FITC fluorescence. As soon as the fusion pore is formed, the lysosomal lumen is rapidly alkalinized resulting in an increase of FITC–dextran fluorescence (“pore opening”). Following the pore opening, the dextran is released and it diffuses away from the site of the fusion, causing the lumenal fluorescence to decrease (“release”).(D) A histogram of the fraction of lumenal contents released by exocytosing lysosomes.

Wing hairs flanking the expression domain point away from it, consistent with previous observations that hair point away from higher levels of Fz1 activity (Adler et al. 1997).(C) dpp>fz1–2-2 wing. Wing hairs are not pointing away from expression domain, suggesting that Fz1–2-2 is not active for PCP signaling.(D) dpp>fz1–1-2 wing. Hairs point away only very slightly (less than 45 o; compare with Fz1–1-1, showing a 90 o reorientation next to expression domain). Several different lines of UAS-fz1–1-1 and UAS-fz1–1-2 were compared, showing identical behavior (Fz1–1-1 having a much stronger phenotype), suggesting that the C-tail is required for full PCP Fz activity.(E) dpp>fz2–1-1 wing. Most wing hairs point away from expression domain. The phenotype is weaker than Fz1–1-1.(F) dpp>fz1–2-1 wing. Wing hair orientation is hardly affected. Since Fz1–2-1 is apically localized (see Figure 2E), this result indicates that the presence of the Fz1 7-TM region is important for PCP activity.\n",

The respective mutations generated and analyzed are indicated above the sequence (see also Table 1 for complete data set).

Examples for Fz1–1-1V559E (V to E substitution) are shown in (B) (localization) and (F) (function). All other mutants analyzed as shown in (A) are listed in Table 1. (C–E, G, and H) show the effects of the Fz2 C-tail-specific sequences. The Fz2 C-tail was truncated at the position of the Fz1 stop codon (amino acid L633), yielding a short Fz2 C-tail (2S). The localization (C and D) and GOF PCP function (G and H) of the respective chimeras, Fz1–2-2S and Fz1–1-2S, is shown. Note that both chimeras localize apically (C and D), and Fz1–1-2S shows a strong PCP GOF phenotype (H), very similar to Fz1–1-1 (see Figure 3B). Fz1–2-2S shows only a very weak PCP phenotype (G), mainly occurring at an anterior distal region of the wing (marked by arrow; the rest of the wing is wild-type). (E) Subcellular localization of Fz1–1-1C2. Fz1–1-1C2 is Fz1 with the addition of the Fz2-specific tail extension (see Materials and Methods).

The plots and table reflect the average for all birds in each group. All recordings were performed under a 12:12 LD photoperiod with lights turned off at 18:00 and on at 06:00.(A) Proportion of time in each behavioral state for nonmigrating (top) and migrating (bottom) birds. The proportion of every 10-min period spent in each sleep/wakefulness state was calculated for each bird and then averaged across all birds: wakefulness (black), drowsiness (gray), SWS (blue), and REM sleep (red). Note that overall sleep propensity in migrating birds is greatly diminished between approximately 22:30 and 06:00. Note also the increased propensity for REM sleep from 18:00 to 20:00 as compared to the same time period when not migrating.(B) Sleep and REM sleep latencies. Sleep latency was calculated as the length of time from lights out until the first occurrence of sleep (in all cases SWS) for birds in a nonmigratory and migratory state; average sleep latency did not differ significantly between nonmigrating and migrating birds. REM sleep latency was calculated as the length of time from sleep onset to the first occurrence of REM sleep. Note that REM sleep occurred earlier in sleep during migration for all five birds that were recorded in both a nonmigratory and migratory state (t = 3.3, paired, two-tailed, p < 0.05). Note also that the REM sleep latencies for the three birds recorded only in a migratory state were shorter than the shortest REM sleep latency in nonmigrating birds.(C) Sleep percentages. Average daily percentages of sleep and wakefulness states for birds in a nonmigrating (n = 5) and migrating (n = 8) state. Total sleep is the sum of SWS and REM sleep. For all states of vigilance, values for the migrating condition differed significantly from the nonmigrating condition (p < 0.01, after Bonferroni correction). The proportion of total sleep occupied by REM sleep was not significantly different between migratory states.\n",

Using polymorphism mapping, we placed b926 between the markers Z5141 (2/362 recombinants/meioses) and Z20494 (3/362 recombinants/meioses). Databases of the partial zebrafish genomic sequence revealed that a homolog of integrinα5 mapped to this region.(B) Zebrafish Integrinα5 protein is predicted to have seven extracellular beta-propeller repeats (stippled), a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular cytoplasmic tail. Integrinα5 forms heterodimeric complexes with Integrin β chains, primarily β1, and binds extracellular matrix ligands containing the RGD motif. Sequencing of integrinα5 in b926 revealed a T to A nucleotide substitution at position 952 of the cDNA that converts a tyrosine to an asparagine at amino acid 218, a residue within the third beta-propeller repeat.(C) Alignment of the third beta-propeller repeat of the Integrinα5 proteins of zebrafish, human, mouse, Xenopus, and Fugu. Y218 is absolutely conserved among all five species and is mutated to N in b926.(D) The genomic locus of integrinα5 consists of 30 exons (not drawn to scale). The integrinα5 morpholino, itga5-MO, was designed against the exon13-intron splice site (arrow).(E) The primers GC145 and GC147 were used to amplify a 497-bp fragment from wild-type cDNA. PCR amplification was then performed using cDNA from 24-hpf embryos that had been injected with 10 ng of itga5-MO at the one-cell stage, the same concentration of morpholino used for our phenotypic analysis. The resultant product was 587 bp long, and sequencing confirmed that the increased length was due to the failure to splice out the intron between exons 13 and 14. The left lane of the agarose gel contains standard size markers in basepairs.(F) A schematic of the wild-type Integrinα5 protein shows seven extracellular repeats and the transmembrane (TM) domain. Inhibition of splicing by itga5-MO would be predicted to result in a nonfunctional protein that is truncated in the seventh repeat of the extracellular domain.\n",

A phenotypic series (B–D) shows that the anterior half of HM (arrows) is absent and SY is progressively reduced in integrinα5− animals. Rarely, mandibular and hyoid joints are also missing in integrinα5− animals (asterisks in D). (E) Animals treated with itga5-MO display similar reductions of HM (arrow) and SY.(F and G) Flat-mount dissections of the pharyngeal cartilages of 4-d-old wild-type (F) and integrinα5− (G) animals. In addition to the mandibular and hyoid cartilages, the five CB cartilages (CB1–CB5) that are derived from the third through seventh arches are shown. Note the teeth on CB5 (dots in F). In integrinα5− embryos we see rare fusions of CB cartilages (arrow in G).(H–J) Confocal micrographs of the pharyngeal arches of wild-type fli1-GFP (H) and integrinα5−; fli1-GFP (I and J) embryos stained with anti-GFP and Zn8 antibodies at 38 hpf. Neural crest cells of the pharyngeal arches are labeled with fli1-GFP (green, numbered in [H]), and the pharyngeal pouches are labeled by the Zn8 antibody (red, numbered p1–p5 in [H]). In integrinα5−; fli1-GFP embryos, the first pouch is absent or very reduced at 38 hpf (arrows in I and J). Less frequently, we also see reductions in more posterior pouches in integrinα5−; fli1-GFP embryos (arrowhead in J shows a single endodermal mass where p3–p5 would be in wild-type embryos). The Zn8 antibody also recognizes cranial sensory ganglia (dots).(K and L) In situ hybridizations of wild-type (K) and integrinα5− (L) embryos stained with the pharyngeal pouch marker pea3 at 36 hpf (arrowhead denotes first pouch). The first pouch of integrinα5− embryos is very reduced, but still expresses pea3. Sensory ganglia also stain with pea3 (dots).(M and N) Cranial muscles of 4-d-old wild-type fli1-GFP (M) and integrinα5−; fli1-GFP (N) embryos stained with MF20 antibody. Mandibular muscles (intermandibularis posterior [imp], adductor mandibulae [am], levator arcus palatine [lap], and do) and hyoid muscles (interhyal , hyohyal [hh], ah, ao, and lo) are labeled in wild-type. integrinα5− embryos have a selective reduction of do and ah muscles (arrow in [N]). Confocal projections of integrinα5− animals did not include ocular muscles (asterisks in M).(O and P) Cranial motor nerves of wild-type islet1-GFP (O) and integrinα5−; islet1-GFP (P) live embryos at 54 hpf. islet1-GFP-expressing cranial motor neurons innervate muscles of the pharyngeal arches with the following strict segmental correspondence: trigeminal (V)—mandibular; facial (VII)—hyoid; glossopharyngeal (IX)—third; and vagus (X)—fourth through seventh. In integrinα5−; islet1-GFP embryos, facial nerve VII (arrowhead in P) is reduced and/or fails to branch.(Q and R) Summary of integrinα5 regional pharyngeal defects extrapolated to a 4-d-old embryo and color-coded for cartilage (blue), muscle (red), and nerve (green). Shown in black are the eye (filled circle within larger circle), ear (two dots within oval), and opercle bone (mushroom). In wild-type animals, facial nerve VII innervates and passes by do and ah muscles that are in close association with the aHM cartilage region (enlarged in Q′). In integrinα5 mutants, we see specific reductions of the first pouch (not shown), the aHM cartilage region, do and ah muscles, and facial nerve VII (enlarged in R′). Scale bars: 50 μm.\n",

A short pulse of current delivers dye into single or pairs of cells. A-P and D-V axes, the mandibular arch (1), and first pouch (p1) are designated in (A) and (B).(B–D) Confocal sections of fli1-GFP-labeled hyoid arches (2) (green) show the positions of Alexa568-labeled cells (red) shortly after microelectroporation (24 hpf).(E-J) At 4 d, confocal micrographs (E–G) (schematized in [H–J]) show the resultant fate of labeled crest cells (red) in the hyoid cartilage regions (green). Examples shown include labeled hyoid cells that contributed exclusively to SY (B, E, and H), aHM (C, F, and I), and pHM (D, G, and J) cartilage regions.(K) The relative distances (normalized to one) of hyoid crest cells at 24 hpf that contributed to SY (red), aHM (blue), and pHM (green) regions are plotted along A-P and D-V axes. The first pouch and partial outline of the mandibular arch (1) are drawn for reference. One cell gave rise to an aHM/pHM (blue/green) mixed lineage, and another cell gave rise to pHM and unidentified cells (green/light blue). SY and aHM progenitors map to more anterior domains (i.e., closer to the first pouch) than do pHM progenitors (relative distances from anterior: SY, 0.12 ± 0.11; aHM, 0.17 ± 0.06; pHM 0.43 ± 0.05; statistically different using Tukey-Kramer HSD test). SY progenitors map to a more ventral domain than do aHM and pHM progenitors (relative distances from dorsal: SY, 0.68 ± 0.11; aHM, 0.33 ± 0.06; pHM 0.37 ± 0.05; statistically different using Tukey-Kramer HSD test).

      " Model for Development and Evolution of Hyoid Cartilage(A–F) Models of hyoid development in wild-type (A–C) and integrinα5− (D–F) animals show the structure of hyoid arches at 24 hpf (A and D) and 38 hpf (B and E) and mandibular and hyoid cartilages at 4 d (C and F).(A) At 24 hpf of wild-type development, crest that will form aHM (dark green), pHM (medium green), and SY (light green) cartilage regions occupy distinct domains within the hyoid arch. Signals (red arrows) from the first pouch (orange) stabilize adjacent aHM- and SY-producing crest.(B) At 38 hpf of wild-type development, aHM- and SY-producing crest tightly pack along the first pouch. Cranial mesoderm (red) and some mandibular crest (blue) are also shown.(C) At 4 d of wild-type development, the HS cartilage is a composite of aHM, pHM, and SY regions. Also shown are the hyoid CH (yellow) and mandibular Meckel's (light blue) and palatoquadrate (dark blue) cartilages.(D) In integrinα5− animals, the first pouch is missing or very reduced at 24 hpf.(E) By 38 hpf, as a consequence of the lack of a first pouch, aHM and SY progenitors are disorganized and undergo gradual apoptosis. In contrast, the development of pHM progenitor cells does not require the first pouch.(F) At 4 d, aHM and SY cartilage regions are selectively reduced in integrinα5− animals.(G–I) The HS element has undergone extensive change during vertebrate evolution. In the illustrations (adapted from De Beer [1937]), the neurocranium is grey or outlined in black and mandibular and hyoid cartilages are color-coded as described above. Based on relations to morphological landmarks and data presented here on the tripartite mosaic development of HS, an evolutionary scheme is proposed.(G) In the dogfish shark Scyliorhinus canicula, a single rod-shaped element corresponds to pro-aHM/SY regions.(H) In the basal actinopterygian Polypterus senegalus, separate aHM and SY regions are present.(I) As shown for salmon, during actinopterygian evolution a new region, pHM, develops posterior to and fuses with aHM to create a wide HM plate that articulates with the neurocranium and supports an enlarged, overlying opercular apparatus (not shown).\n",

      " The Primate APOBEC Family(A) The human genome contains nine known members of the APOBEC family. AID and APOBEC1 are located approximately 900 kb apart on human Chromosome 12. The primate-specific APOBEC3 cluster of six genes resides on human Chromosome 22, and likely arose through a series of gene duplication events (Jarmuz et al. 2002; Wedekind et al. 2003). The single APOBEC3-like gene found in mouse resides on Chromosome 15 (not shown), which is syntenic to human Chromosome 22 (Sheehy et al. 2002). There is EST evidence for both APOBEC3D and APOBEC3DE (see Materials and Methods), and we treat these as three separate transcripts in our analysis because currently there is no evidence for the relevant protein products.(B) All members of the APOBEC family contain an active site that encodes a zinc-dependent cytidine deaminase domain with the HXE, PCXXC signature (Mian et al. 1998), a linker peptide, and a pseudoactive domain (Navaratnam et al. 1998; Jarmuz et al. 2002). The active and pseudoactive domains are related by structure only, and likely originated from a gene duplication event followed by degeneration of the catalytic activity of the pseudoactive domain. Several members of the human APOBEC3 gene cluster (APOBEC3B, 3DE, 3F, and3G) have undergone an additional duplication/recombination event and now contain two each of the active and pseudoactive sites (Jarmuz et al. 2002; Wedekind et al. 2003), as does the single APOBEC3-like gene found in mouse.DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0020275.g001\n",

      " Episodic Positive Selection on Different Regions of the APOBEC3G Gene(A–C) Sliding window (300-bp window; 50-bp slide) analysis of Ka and Ks was performed on three representative pairs of primate APOBEC3G sequences, between two hominids (human–orangutan) (A), between two OWMs (crested macaque–baboon) (B), and between two NWMs (tamarin–woolly monkey) (C). Ka/Ks, Ka, and Ks are plotted against the length of the gene (with a schematic of protein domains along the x-axis) to illustrate that different domains of APOBEC3G have undergone positive selection, depending on which lineage is examined. The value for ω, indicated by Ka/Ks, is not shown for part of the crested macaque–baboon comparison (B), because Ks is zero in this region (see plot below).(D) A schematic of the domains of human APOBEC3G illustrates the N-terminal domain (aa 1–29), the two active sites (aa 30–120 and 215–311), and the pseudoactive sites (aa 162–214 and 348–384). Also illustrated is the Vif-interaction domain of APOBEC3G (aa 54–124) (Conticello et al. 2003) as well as the single amino acid residue responsible for species-specific sensitivity to Vif (aspartic acid 128; cross shape in linker 1) (Bogerd et al. 2004; Schrofelbauer et al. 2004). PAML (Yang 1997) was used to identify individual residues (codons) that have significant posterior probabilities of ω greater than 1.0 (see Materials and Methods). Those codons with posterior probabilities greater than 0.95 and greater than 0.99 are indicated by open and closed inverted triangles, respectively (listed in Figures S2 and S3). This represents only a subset of the residues that are likely to be under positive selection, highlighting those residues that have repeatedly undergone non-synonymous substitutions. For instance, residue 128 is not highlighted, as it has a posterior probability of only 0.55 because it has undergone only one fixed non-synonymous change (along the OWM lineage). Domains have been defined by protein sequence alignment to APOBEC1 (Jarmuz et al. 2002). The first pseudoactive domain is likely to include in its C-terminus a second duplication of the N-terminal domain, although this boundary cannot be resolved because of sequence divergence.DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0020275.g003\n",

Cells containing the ectopic centromere and isogenic wild-type cells (1829-15B) were staged in G1 using αF, and then released into fresh medium containing nocodazole to arrest cells in mitosis. Cells were then fixed in formaldehyde and processed for ChIP using epitope-tagged Mcd1-6HAp as a marker for the cohesin complex.(A) The Mcd1p binding profiles at the ectopic location on endogenous CHRIII (black squares) and in the presence of the ectopic centromere (gray circles) are shown. The location of the ectopic centromere is indicated by the black oval.(B) The levels of Mcd1p binding in the region flanking the ectopically placed centromere were divided by those observed in the isogenic wild-type control strain to determine the fold increases in Mcd1p binding in the presence of the centromere.

      " A Model for Lamellocyte Specification(A) A model for the induction of lamellocyte differentiation in the Drosophila lymph glands in response to wasp parasitization. Col enables PSC cells to respond to a primary signal (S1) that is likely emitted by plasmatocytes upon their encounter with a parasite (Russo et al. 1996; Meister 2004). As a result, the PSC cells send a secondary signal (S2) that causes prohemocytes to develop into lamellocytes. Notch (N) signalling instructs a fraction of prohemocytes to become crystal cells (Duvic et al. 2002; Lebestky et al. 2003). The circular arrow indicates that increased proliferation leading to increased numbers of crystal cells and lamellocytes follows parasitization (Sorrentino et al. 2002).(B) Schematic view of hematopoiesis in Drosophila and mouse. Left: Lymph gland cells contain two types of hematopoietic cells, PSC cells and uncommitted precursors. These precursors can give rise to either plasmatocytes or crystal cells. Crystal cell precursors can also give rise to lamellocytes upon receiving a signal from the PSC cells expressing Col (dotted arrows); this signalling is itself dependent upon a communication between circulating plasmatocytes and the PSC (A). Right: In mice, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) give rise to common myeloid precursors (CMP) and common lymphoid precursors (CLP) (adapted from Orkin [2000] and Schebesta et al. [2002]). Signalling between CMP- and CLP-derived cells is an essential component of adaptive immunity. Col and EBF functions, in Drosophila and vertebrate hematopoiesis, respectively, suggest an ancestral role in their conferring on a subset of hematopoietic cells the ability to respond to signals from circulating immune supervisors (generically designated here as macrophages) and to provide a secondary line of defence against specific intruders.\n",

      " Model of Gcn4p/Hac1p Action in the UPR(A) The expanded circuitry of the UPR. The classical UPR (red), the S-UPR (blue), and regulated Gcn4p levels (green) are integrated at target promoters. Transcriptional regulation of HAC1 mRNA levels, providing one level of gain control, is depicted as a rheostat under supervision of a logical AND gate informed by multiple inputs from the ER. Splicing of HAC1 mRNA by Ire1p, providing a binary on/off control, is depicted by a switch. Regulation of Gcn4p levels by Gcn2p under changing cellular conditions adds an additional layer of gain control. Together, activity levels of Hac1p, Gcn4p, and the proposed UPR modulatory factor (Leber et al. 2004) collaborate to determine the magnitude of the transcriptional output signal.(B) Mechanism of Gcn4p/Hac1p action at target promoters. In the absence of Hac1p, Gcn4p is present in the cell as a consequence of baseline activity of Gcn2p. At normal concentrations, Gcn4p is unable to bind or activate a target UPRE, but it may bind when Gcn4p levels are elevated. Upon induction of the UPR, Ire1p is activated and Hac1 is synthesized. Hac1p can bind, but not activate, target UPREs. Binding of target DNA by a Gcn4p/Hac1p heterodimer results in a transcriptionally active complex. Gcn4p levels are upregulated under UPR induction, perhaps as a consequence of stabilization by interaction with Hac1p.\n",

Cellular immune reactions consist of phagocytosis, encapsulation, and melanization.(B) A dead and melanized crystal cell phagocytosed by a plasmatocyte.(C) Encapsulation of an egg of a Drosophila parasite. The parasite is a wasp that normally infects larvae. Cells surrounding the egg are lamellocytes. The cells and the egg are stained with a fluorescent nuclear stain.(D) Clot formation occurs during wound healing.(E) Crystal cells in contact with the larval cuticle. The contents of the crystal cells are melanized. Melanization occurs in response to intruding pathogens or parasites and is also observed during wound healing.(F) Humoral immune reaction. The expression of antimicrobial peptides in the larval fat body is induced by microbes. Cells of the fat body appear green due to the presence of a transgene encoding the green fluorescent protein, under the control of the drosomycin promoter. The drosomycin promoter is activated in response to fungal infections and is under the control of the Toll pathway (see Figure 2). Antimicrobial peptides are released from the fat body into the hemolymph. This response is therefore systemic. A similar antimicrobial gene activation response can occur locally in specific body parts such as the trachea or the gut (not shown).\n",

      " Two new transposons for generating multicolored GFP fusion protein libraries. In-frame insertions of the Either-Or transposon, <EYOR> (A), within another coding sequence initially create truncated C-terminal YFP fusions. Alternate restriction digestion with Asc I or Srf I removes one of the fluorescent proteins and the KanR. Subsequent re-ligation produces identical full-length YFP and CFP fusion proteins. The fluorescent protein is flanked by 9 amino acid linkers encoded by the Tn5 MEs and restriction sites. The Double Barrel transposon, <DBT> (B), encodes green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP and DsRed) antiparallel to one another. Therefore, <DBT> insertions with another coding sequence have a 1:3 chance of being in-frame regardless of orientation. The GFP coding sequence uses the same reading frame through the Tn5 MEs as YFP in <EYOR>. DsRed however, has been shifted by 1 bp to use a different reading frame through the Tn5 MEs, doubling the number of usable insertion sites within a target coding sequence (Note that the reading frame shown in <DBT> is that used for DsRed, translated from the lower DNA strand, and is read from right to left).\n",

If elo-5 is suppressed in parental animals after they have begun to synthesize mmBCFA, then their eggs will have a reduced C17ISO level that is still above the critical low level, which permits these animals to grow but causes them to display gonadal defects. These worms produce a small number of progeny that is then arrested in L1.

CBFA2T3B and CBFA2T3 expressed at endogenously low yet aberrant levels in breast tumor cell lines. Using normal breast as a reference, CBFA2T3B (600 mRNA mlcls per 104 cells) and CBFA2T3 (1,800) were low compared to ATP5A (600,000) and CYPA (1,600,000). CBFA2T3 expression ranged 30,000-fold from 4 to 120,000 mRNA mlcls per 104cells in MDA-MB-231 and BT-483, respectively. In contrast, CYPA and ATP5A expression ranged 2-fold and 20-fold, respectively (100–200 and 15–300 mRNA mlcls per cell). Expression levels were also examined in several primary breast tumor samples for which total RNA was available (see Figure 6).

      " Mendel's diagrammatic explanation for the formation of the F2 population of plants produced by self-fertilisation of his F1 hybrids. Mendel proposed that F1 hybrids (Aa) contained a dominant trait (A) that was displayed and a recessive trait (a) that was not displayed. Self-fertilisation of F1 hybrids (Aa) then involved segregation of the component traits (A) and (a) into individual male pollen and female germinal cells, as shown in his diagram. Mendel proposed that if a male pollen cell carrying a trait (A) fertilised a female germinal cell carrying the same trait (A), the progeny would display trait (A). He used the analogous argument for the generation of progeny bearing trait (a). Only if male and female sex cells carried differing forms of a given trait (A or a but not both) would the progeny be hybrids (Aa). Thus random recombination of the segregated traits during self-fertilisation of hybrids would yield (on average) the F2 population of plants represented by the trait series (A + 2Aa + a) shown below Mendel's original diagram.\n",

      " Measuring Selection Pressures by Comparing the Ratio of Nonsynonymous to Synonymous Substitutions Per Site(A) Classification of substitutions. Nonsynonymous substitutions (red) are those that change the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene, while the degeneracy of the genetic code ensures that synonymous substitutions (yellow) result in the same amino acid sequence.(B) Calculation of dN/dS. By assuming that synonymous mutations are neutral and fixed by random genetic drift, it is possible to determine the mode of selection acting on nonsynonymous mutations. If all nonsynonymous substitutions were neutral, then their rate of occurrence per site (dN) would be the same as that of synonymous substitutions per site (dS), so that dN/dS equals one. A lower ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS < 1) means that some proportion of the nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious and removed by purifying selection. Conversely, positive selection fixes advantageous nonsynonymous mutations faster than genetic drift fixes synonymous mutations (dN/dS > 1), although this is usually restricted to a small proportion of amino acid sites within any gene. In the hypothetical example of five gene sequences shown here, with dS given above the diagonal and dN below the diagonal, there is no evidence for positive selection because mean dN/dS the (0.577) is less than one.\n",

      " Lethal Mutagenesis As a Means of Controlling RNA Virus Infections(A) In a viral population prior to the application of mutagens, the mean error rate (white) is on the order of one per genome per replication (mutations marked by asterisks). (B) If a mutagen such as ribavirin is then applied to an infected patient, the mean error rate of the virus (black) is increased so that the population crosses a threshold of ‘error catastrophe’; after this point fitness declines dramatically and the population crashes. This drug-induced lethal mutagenesis seems to work more efficiently when it is used in combination with drugs that reduce the rate of viral replication.\n",

      " The Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis of Aux/IAA Proteins Regulates Auxin Response(A) Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and the axr2-1 mutant. axr2-1 is a dominant gain-of-function mutation in an Aux/IAA gene that confers reduced auxin response. The mutant axr2-1 protein constitutively represses auxin response because it cannot be targeted for proteolysis by the SCFTIR1 ubiquitin ligase. The effect of the mutation on AXR2 stability is shown in a pulse-chase experiment (inset). Wild-type and axr2-1 seedlings were labeled with 35S-methionine and AXR2/axr2-1 protein was immunoprecipitated either immediately after the labeling period (t = 0) or following a 15-minute chase with unlabeled methionine (t = 15).(B) A simplified model for auxin response. In the absence of an auxin stimulus, Aux/ IAA proteins inhibit ARF transcriptional activity by forming heterodimers. Auxin perception (by an unknown receptor) targets the Aux/IAA proteins to the SCFTIR1 complex, resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation, thereby de-repressing the ARF transcription factors. Among the ARF targets are the Aux/IAA genes themselves, which produce nascent Aux/IAA proteins that restore repression upon the pathway in a negative feedback loop.\n",

      " Model for Conformational Changes during Ffh-FtsY Reciprocal GTPase Activation and Implications for the Protein-Targeting Reaction(A) Model for conformational changes during formation of an activated Ffh-FtsY complex. Step a is the rearrangement of both proteins from the open to the closed state during complex formation. Step b is the coordinate docking of the IBD loops into the active sites, and step c is the docking of the Arg191s. Step d is the additional rearrangement of residues that completes one or the other GTPase site. Step e is the rearrangement that completes the other active site. GTP can be hydrolyzed from either the hemiactivated complexes (step f) or the activated complex (step g) to drive complex dissociation.(B–D) Catalytic interactions made by residues exhibiting the Class II phenotype. FtsY is in surface representation, the catalytic residues from FtsY are depicted as red sticks, the nucleotides bound to FtsY and Ffh are in dark green and dark blue, respectively, and the dotted lines depict hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts.(B) Interaction of IBD loop with GTP in the FtsY active site. The blue ball represents the attacking water molecule (A.W.); the violet red ball represents the active site Mg2+.(C) Interactions of Asn111(107) at the Ffh-FtsY interface. The residue homologous to Asn111, Gln107 in Ffh, is in violet red.(D) Arg195(191) is in a “pending” position. The residue homologous to Arg191 in Ras, Gln61, is in violet red.(E) Conformational changes in the GTPase domains of SRP and SR provide potential regulatory points during the protein-targeting reaction. Step 1, SR undergoes an open → closed conformational change upon association with the membrane translocon. Step 2, SRP undergoes an open → closed conformational change upon association with the ribosome and nascent polypeptide. Step 3, complex formation between SRP and SR delivers the cargo to the membrane. Step 4, cargo release from SRP allows the SRP•SR complex to undergo additional conformational changes to activate GTP hydrolysis. Step 5, SRP dissociates from SR after GTP is hydrolyzed. Note that steps 1–3 correspond to Ffh-FtsY binding (step a) in the model shown in (A), step 4 corresponds to Ffh•FtsY activation (steps b–e) in the model shown in (A), and step 5 corresponds to Ffh•FtsY complex dissociation (step g) in the model shown in (A).\n",

      " The Mother-Cell Line of Gene Transcription(A) Gene transcription is governed by a hierarchical regulatory cascade that involves gene activation and gene repression. The σE factor turns on a large regulon that includes the genes for GerR and SpoIIID. These DNA-binding proteins, in turn, block further transcription of many of the genes that had been activated by σE. SpoIIID is also an activator, and it turns on genes required for the appearance of pro-σK. The conversion of pro-σK to mature σK is governed by a signal emanating from the forespore as represented by the squiggle. Next, σK activates the subsequent regulon in the cascade, which includes the gene for the DNA-binding protein GerE. Finally, GerE, which, like SpoIIID, is both an activator and a repressor, turns on the final regulon in the cascade while also repressing many of the genes that had been activated by σK. The thickness of lines represents the relative abundance of genes activated (arrows) or repressed (lines ending in bars) by the indicated regulatory proteins.(B) The regulatory circuit is composed of two coherent FFLs linked in series and three incoherent FFLs. In the first coherent FFL, σE turns on the synthesis of SpoIIID, and both factors act together to switch on target genes, including genes involved in the appearance of σK. Likewise, in the second coherent FFL, σK directs the synthesis of GerE, and the two factors then act together to switch on target genes (X4). The σE factor and SpoIIID also constitute an incoherent FFL in which SpoIIID acts as a repressor to downregulate the transcription of a subset of the genes (X2) that had been turned on by σE. Similar incoherent FFLs are created by the actions of σE and GerR (X1) and by σK and GerE (X3), with GerR and GerE repressing genes that had been switched on by σE and σK, respectively. The AND symbols indicate that the FFLs operate by the logic of an AND gate in that the output (either gene activation or a pulse of gene expression) requires the action of both transcription factors in the FFL (see Mangan and Alon 2003). For example, σK and GerE are both required for the activation of X4 genes, whose induction is delayed compared to genes that are turned on by σK alone. Similarly, both σE and the delayed appearance of GerR are anticipated to create a pulse of transcription of X1 genes.\n",

      " Accounting for Mendel's observation of a 3(dominant):1(recessive) trait ratio in his F2 populations of plants. Mendel's notations for a dominant trait, a hybrid and a recessive trait were (A), (Aa) and (a) respectively. For reasons given in the preceding paper [1], a hybrid trait is represented in Figure 2 by (H). The molecular components of all traits are synthesised by a metabolic pathway. When the activity of any one enzyme in a metabolic pathway is changed in discrete steps, the flux to a trait component responds in non-linear (non-additive) fashion [3]. If the flux response is quasi-hyperbolic, as shown here, the hybrid trait (H) will be indistinguishable from the trait (A) expressed in the wild-type cell or organism, even when the enzyme activity in the hybrid (H) has been reduced to 50% of the wild-type activity. Trait (a), will be distinguishable from both traits (A) and (H) only if the enzyme activity is further reduced to a sufficient extent. Under these circumstances the trait series (A + 2H + a) becomes (3A + a); Mendel's 3(dominant):1(recessive) trait ratio is accounted for without introducing arbitrary and inconsistent arguments [1].\n",

      " Disulfide Mapping of Oxidized MetE Reveals That Cysteine 645 Is Glutathionylated(A) LC-MS analysis of fragments generated by cyanylation, cleavage, and total reduction (see Figure 4) of GSSG-oxidized (red) and reduced (blue) MetE. For oxidized MetE, peaks corresponding to F and I were not found. Instead, a peak was observed with a mass corresponding to J, itz643–753, with one reduced uncyanylated cysteine and β-elimination at the other cysteine. As discussed in the text, β-elimination occurs preferentially at cysteine 726 in the reduced enzyme, and we infer that the reduced uncyanylated cysteine is cysteine 645.(B) LC-MS analysis of the cleavage products in (A) prior to DTT reduction (black) or following total reduction (red). Prior to DTT reduction, a peak is observed that has a mass corresponding to that expected for K, itz643–753, with a glutathione adduct at one cysteine and β-elimination at the other cysteine. As discussed in the text, β-elimination occurs preferentially at cysteine 726 in the reduced enzyme, and we infer that the glutathionylated cysteine is cysteine 645. The peak containing fragment J, the product of DTT reduction, is no longer apparent. The broad peak, indicated by the asterisk, appeared to contain a mixture of fragments with masses that could not be deconvoluted. These were attributed to disulfide-linked byproducts formed under the basic cleavage conditions prior to reduction with DTT.\n",

      " The Equilibrium Constant for MetE Oxidation Is Consistent with MetE Inactivation In Vivo(A) MetE was incubated with the indicated [GSH]/[GSSG] ratios at 1.1 mM (yellow), 2.3 mM (red), 4.6 mM (green), or 9.1 mM (blue) GSH until equilibrium was reached, as judged by a constant level of activity with time. MetE activity was then assayed to determine the relative amount of active reduced enzyme. The equilibrium constant, Kmix (see equation 2) was determined to be 1.4 from the plot of relative MetE activity versus [GSH]/[GSSG]. This value was independent of the GSH concentration and dependent only on the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio, consistent with glutathionylation as the mechanism of inactivation.(B) Cellular redox potentials are often referenced in terms of the GSH–GSSG couple, which depends upon [GSH]2/[GSSG]. Since inactivation of MetE occurs via glutathionylation (which is dependent on [GSH]/[GSSG]), a redox potential (which is dependent on [GSH]2/[GSSG]) for inactivation of MetE (by equilibrium titration with GSH/GSSG) cannot be determined. In order to provide a physiological context for the Kmix determined in vitro, the equilibrium fraction of MetE expected to be active at different glutathione concentrations, 1 mM (red), 2 mM (green), and 5 mM (blue), was determined as a function of the cellular potential as described in the text. The regions designated “normal growth” and “oxidative stress” were inferred from published estimates of typical redox potentials in cells experiencing these conditions (Gilbert 1990).\n",

      " In Vivo Thiol-Trapping Experiments(A) The strategy for in vivo thiol trapping involves brief incubation with iodoacetamide, which is able to efficiently alkylate all available thiols. Oxidized cysteines in the TCA-precipitated proteins are reduced, and the sulfhydryls exposed are then trapped with iodoacetic acid, which adds a negative charge. The two forms of the protein are separated by isoelectric focusing, and MetE is visualized by immunoblotting. Oxidized MetE results in a more acidic band on the gel than reduced MetE.(B) Thiol-trapping experiments were performed on a trxA gor strain (WP843) of E. coli (lane 2) as well as the isogenic wild-type strain (DHB4) (lane 1).

      " Inverse Roelofs Effect for Remembered Space(A) An inverse Roelofs effect for immediate (solid line) and delayed (dashed line) sensorimotor responses toward remembered reference array locations, with a significant main effect of frame offset and a significant frame × delay interaction. When tested separately, the main effect of frame offset was significant for both immediate and delayed responses (Table 1; see also Figure S3).(B) The inverse Roelofs effect for remembered space can be used to predict the pattern of the Roelofs effect for targets presented within an offset frame. For example, a frame offset to the right would cause the remembered comparison array to be mislocalized as being shifted approximately 1° to the right (from Figure 3A, solid line); a target presented at the center location of the comparison array (i.e., at the objective midline) would therefore be reported to lie approximately 1° to the left of the remembered center location. Computed in this way for all target and frame locations, the predicted Roelofs effect (gray lines and data points) closely matched the measured Roelofs effect for the perceptual judgment (black lines and data points, from Figure 2A, solid line), with a predicted effect size (1.61°) that did not significantly differ from the measured effect (1.47° ± 0.32°; t[9] = 0.44, n.s.). Furthermore, the measured Roelofs effect did not differ from the predicted effect for any individual frame position (left frame: t[9] = 0.39, n.s.; center frame: t[9] = 0.01, n.s.; right frame: t[9] = 0.36, n.s.).\n",

      " Task and BehaviorBehavioral task (A) and representative horizontal and vertical eye position records (B). (A) Each trial began when the monkeys pressed a button to make a fixation point (FP) appear at the center of the video monitor. Some time after the monkeys fixated the FP (dashed lines), a gray circle (depicted here as white) appeared at one of four peripheral locations. The figure illustrates its appearance at the 0° location (part a). The monkeys had to remember this location later in the task; hence we termed it the remembered location. On most trials, the circle subsequently revolved around the FP to a different location, as the monkeys maintained central fixation. The figure illustrates its termination at the 90° location (part b). A small change in the circle's luminance (part c) signaled the monkeys where to look next. This cue persisted for 150 ms, then disappeared. Because the monkeys depended on this subtle and brief cue for both timing and targeting information, we termed this the attended location. If the circle dimmed (dark gray, part c, top), the monkeys had to make a saccade to the attended location (Att-trials, part d, top). If the circle brightened (starburst, part c, bottom), the monkeys had to make a saccade to the remembered location (Rem-trials, part d, bottom). After saccade initiation, the central FP disappeared and, if the monkeys made a saccade to the correct location, a new FP appeared there (not shown). The monkeys had to fixate the new FP and, after it dimmed, release the button to produce a fruit juice reward. (Monkey drawing courtesy of Dr. Michael Shadlen.)\n",

      " Definition of Structural and Functional Motifs, and Motif Detection(A) From a network, we select a subset of three vertices and their interconnections, representing a candidate structural motif.(B) The candidate motif is matched to the 13 motif classes for motif size M = 3. Numbers refer to the ID. The candidate motif is detected as a motif with ID = 13. In detecting structural motifs, only exact matches of candidate motif and motif class are counted.(C) A single instance of a structural motif contains many instances of functional motifs. Here, a structural motif (M = 3, ID = 13) is shown to contain, for example, two distinct instances of the functional motif ID = 9, one motif ID = 2, and one motif ID = 7. Many other distinct instances of functional motifs are present that are not shown in the figure. Note that, in order to be counted as a functional motif of size M = 3, all three vertices of the original structural motif must participate.

The only difference in the two trees is the location of C57BLKS/J, which splits from C57BL/6J sooner in the phylogenic tree because of the genomic contributions of the non-C57 strain, DBA/2J. The maximum parsimony phylogenic tree of the strain relatedness was built using the pseudoalignment of the 10,990 SNP alleles for 48 strains with the Phylip package, version 3.6b.(B) The DBA/2J contribution to C57BLKS/J can be visualized in its allelic patterns.

The monomer of α-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein with several repeats, shown by dark bars on the monomer. The protein has an innate tendency to aggregate with other molecules of α-synuclein, first into oligomers (also known as protofibrils), then into fibrils. It is the fibrillar forms of α-synuclein that are deposited into the classic pathological structures of PD, Lewy bodies. There are several studies that suggest that the oligomeric intermediates are the major toxic species, although this is not certain. (B) shows the recessive mutations associated with parkinsonism and their possible relationships to subcellular targets, either mitochondria (left) or the proteasome (right). Insults to either of these can cause cellular damage and may interact. For example, proteasome inhibitors can cause mitochondrial damage, which can be antagonized by PINK1. Parkin can promote the turnover of proteasomal substrates, and DJ-1 can prevent mitochondrial damage.Quite whether (B) relates to (A) is not clear, but recent results with DJ-1 imply that DJ-1 has chaperone activity towards oligomers of α-synuclein (see text). Although there is much to be done to resolve the order of these events, it is likely that, either alone or in concert, damage to multiple cellular pathways leads to neuronal dysfunction and, eventually, cell death.\n",

Reporter units are separated from the activator units by the pBSII backbone. YFP (pCG3.0Y) or CFP (pCG5.0WCS/6.0WCS) open reading frames are placed downstream of 4 UAS elements and followed by a SV40 polyadenylation signal. Entire expression cassettes are flanked by the IR/DRs of the SB transposon system. Additionally, I-SceI meganuclease sites flank the expression cassettes of activator vectors. Abbreviations and actual sizes of each vector are given. B-E'; Wild type medaka embryos were injected with pCG5.0WCS and MN and subjected to heat-shock treatment (B, B') or with MN and Gal4/Vp16 mRNA without treatment (C, C').

Microinjection of the activator/reporter plasmid pCG5.0WCS results in activation of CFP according to the distribution of plasmid DNA (B-C'). In contrast, induction of activator and reporter in the transgenic line by mRNA injection or heat-shock treatment results in ubiquitous and entirely uniform expression of CFP (D-E').

These data (C) also show that the absence of Pol I increases point mutation (reported previously, Harris 1997) in a completely DinB-dependent manner. This could occur via the absence of Pol I leading to SOS induction (Bates et al. 1989) and more DinB/Pol IV, or via relief of a competition between high-fidelity Pol I and error-prone Pol IV at the replisome.

Control flies show robust circadian rhythms with clear distinctions between activity during the subjective day and inactivity during the subjective night. The pattern of the EP1306 and hdprev83 mutants was more stochastic.(B) Graph showing the proportion of strongly rhythmic (white), weakly rhythmic (gray), and arrhythmic (black) flies for each genotype. Most control flies had strong rhythms (28/30 for Ctl-1 and 27/29 for Ctl-2) while Lmo mutants formed a series with an increasing fraction of the flies arrhythmic. For example, 13/26 hdprev83 flies were arrhythmic, with the other 13 all having weak rhythms. The power of the rhythm was used to estimate the strength of the activity rhythm, with a power of 300 or more classed as a strong rhythm and a power between 300 and 170 classed as a weak rhythm; arrhythmics were given a power of 170 (for analysis below). Between 24 and 30 flies were assayed for each genotype. There were no major differences in the period length of the rhythmic flies in each genotype (Ctl-1, 23.6 ± 0.3; Ctl-2, 23.5 ± 0.5; EP1383, 23.2 ± 0.4; EP1306, 23.4 ± 0.3; hdpR26, 24.2 ± 0.5; and hdprev83, 23.4 ± 0.3).(C) Quantitation of the average power of the rhythm with error bars showing standard error of the mean.

      " A Model for LNv and LMO Regulation of Cocaine Sensitivity(A) In wild type, LNvs modulate locomotor responses via electrical activity and synaptic transmission. We propose a model in which cocaine acts to directly increase LNv activity. Upon cocaine administration, synaptic DA concentrations are increased (via cocaine's inhibition of the plasma membrane DA transporter). Activation of presumed DA receptors on the LNv (dark arrowheads) stimulates electrical activity and subsequent synaptic output. This activity contributes to the behavioral response of the fly to cocaine.(B) LNv ablations eliminate LNv contribution to the cocaine response, reducing cocaine sensitivity.(C) In our model, Lmo loss-of-function mutants (LmoLOF), which have increased cocaine sensitivity, have increased activity/output during the cocaine response. This increased activity may be mediated by increases in receptor content on the LNv or by recruitment of other LNvs that normally do not participate in the cocaine response.(D) Lmo gain-of-function mutants (LmoGOF) mutants have reduced LNv output and reduced cocaine sensitivity. This could also result from a reduction in receptor density.\n",

      " Model Schematic(A) shows a simple cartoon of the bacterium and some actin filaments (explicit players) against a backdrop of a moving diffusion–reaction grid attached to the bacterium. We use this spherical coordinate grid, whose origin moves with the bacterium, to keep track of the diffusion and biochemical interactions of the scalar protein concentrations fields that characterize implicit players. Protein size greatly impacts diffusion of proteins in a cellular environment (Luby-Phelps 1994, 2000), so we modify the nominal diffusion coefficients of implicit players accordingly. The dotted line is the path trajectory in 3D space of the bacterium.(B) illustrates the origin of forces that act on a bacterium in our simulation. Actin filament α is bound to an ActA protein on the bacterial surface, generating a link force that acts to hold the two objects together. Filament β is shown colliding with the bacterium, generating a collision force that acts to push the two objects apart. The barbed end of filament γ is nominally too close to bacterial surface to allow addition of an actin monomer, but Brownian motion might bend the filament into the dotted configuration, thus allowing polymerization and creating a collision. We model our filaments as rigid rods, but simulate this filament flexibility with a polymerization probability function that approaches zero with the filament–bacterium gap; i.e., it is possible for a filament to add a monomer even if the nominal filament–bacterium gap is less than 2.7 nm (the filament length increase per actin monomer). The bacterium, actin filaments, and structures of actin filaments are all subject to Brownian simulation forces and torques, represented by δ.\n",

We line-fit and filter trajectories by slope (speed) to identify pauses in the bacterial motion. Any line with slope less than the pause threshold might indicate a pause. The distance between adjacent pause locations is the step-size, assembled into a histogram in (A). No characteristic step-size is evident; smaller steps are simply more probable than larger ones. We exclude steps shorter than 0.2 nm. (B) shows a pause duration histogram; here we exclude pauses <8 ms in duration. (C) shows run speed histograms for runs >50 ms in duration.

      "spastin Mutant Flies Have Compromised Motor Behavior and Reduced Lifespans(A) In a flight test assay, over twice as many adult spastin hypomorphs (spastin10-12 and spastin17-7) fail to fly before falling to the bottom of a cylinder, in comparison to w1118 and T32 homozygous controls.(B) Although fewer than half of the hypomorphs fly, compared to more than 70% of controls, the distribution of collision sites of the fliers along the height of the cylinder parallels that of the controls, suggesting that these spastin mutations affect flying ability in some animals but not in others.(C and D) spastin mutants are compromised in their climbing ability. (C) All control (WCS) and nearly all spastin hypomorphs climb to the top of a vial in 30 s, but only 40% of spastin nulls do so. (D) Climbing velocity (measured for those flies that reach the top in 30 s) is 3.8 ± 0.2 cm/s in WCS (n = 45), but only 1.8 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 1.1 cm/s in spastin10-12 (n = 28) and spastin17-7 (n = 38) flies, respectively, and 0.3 ± 0.1 cm/s in spastin5.75 null mutants (n = 17; p < 1 × 10−8 for all relative to WCS).(E) Lifespan curves. The curve inflection point at which WCS and hypomorph flies begin to die off at a rapid rate occurs at 30–35 d after eclosion, and more than 70% of hypomorph flies and 95% of wild-type flies are still alive at 30 d. In contrast, approximately 45% of spastin5.75 null mutant flies die prior to 4 d after eclosion. However, the majority of the remaining null flies survive more than 25 d, so that the curve inflection point for nulls occurs only a few days before that for controls and hypomorphs.(F) Mean lifespan is 46 ± 2.7 d in WCS controls (n = 39) compared to 35 ± 3.2 and 35 ± 3.4 d, respectively, in spastin10-12 (n = 24, p < 0.02) and spastin17-7 (n = 32, p < 0.006), and 7.6 ± 0.6 d in nulls (n = 62, p < 10−31).(G) Only about 10% of spastin5.75 flies eclosing at room temperature are males, while 40%–45% are males for controls and hypomorphs.\n",

      " The Distribution of Stable NMJ Microtubule Bundles Marked by the MAP1B-like Protein Futsch Is Altered in spastin Mutant Larvae(A–C) Anti-Futsch labels stable microtubule bundles in axons, NMJ boutons, and interbouton regions. The muscle 4 NMJs in segment A3 of third instar wild-type (A), spastin5.75 (B), and spin-GAL4/UAS-spastin; spastin5.75 (Rescue) (C) larvae were immunostained with anti-HRP (A and B) or anti-Syt antibodies (C) to label presynaptic boutons (magenta), and mAb 22C10 to label Futsch protein (A–C, green). Arrows and arrowheads mark the terminal boutons (those at the ends of synaptic branches); boutons marked by arrows in (A–C) are enlarged in insets in the middle and right panels to show examples of Futsch patterns. (A) In control (WCS) larvae, terminal boutons have both looped (arrowheads) and diffuse, punctate (right panel, arrows and inset) patterns of Futsch staining. (B) In spastin mutants, Futsch staining appears similarly strong in axon bundles (not shown) and along the main branches of the bouton arbor. More distal and terminal boutons, however, have diffuse or no Futsch staining (arrows and arrowheads). Note the absence of green staining in insets. (C) The distribution of Futsch staining is restored to the control pattern by spin-GAL4-driven expression of Spastin in the mutant background (arrows and arrowheads indicate loops). Scale bar, 5 μm.(D and E) Quantitative assessment of Futsch staining data. Futsch staining at A2 and A3 muscle 4 NMJs was classified as continuous (bundles or splayed bundles), looped, or diffuse or undetectable (none) for each bouton. (D) The percentage of boutons exhibiting continuous or looped Futsch staining (relative to the total number of boutons for each NMJ) is decreased in spastin mutants relative to controls, while the percentage of boutons having diffuse or no staining is increased. In total, 58% ± 4.2% of boutons in controls have a continuous pattern of Futsch staining, while only 42% ± 1.5% do in mutants. Boutons in this class are predominantly along the major (more proximal) branches of the axon arbor. Similarly, 11% ± 1.7% of wild-type boutons have Futsch loops, but only 6.0% ± 1.1% do in mutants. Most mutant boutons show only diffuse or no Futsch staining (52% ± 2.2%, versus 32% ± 5.2% in controls). Futsch distribution is restored to the control pattern by spin-GAL4- or Elav-GS-GAL4-driven expression of Spastin. (E) The difference in Futsch distribution is most pronounced at terminal boutons. There is no detectable Futsch staining in the majority of terminal boutons (65% ± 4.5%) in spastin mutants, compared to only 7.8% ± 5.8% of terminal boutons in wild-type larvae (p < 2 × 10−6). Futsch staining is restored in most terminal boutons of spin-GAL4- or Elav-GS-GAL4-rescued larvae, with only 20% ± 3.7% and 19% ± 5.9% of boutons, respectively, showing no staining (p = 0.09 compared to WCS). Terminal bouton staining in larvae overexpressing Spastin in neurons was unaffected relative to controls (p = 0.12). **, p < 0.005; *, p < 0.03 relative to WCS;\n",

      " The Microtubule Network in NMJ Boutons Is Altered or Absent in spastin Mutant Larvae(A) In wild-type (WCS) larvae, an antibody against α-tubulin (green) reveals the distribution of the network of microtubule bundles within the A3 muscle 4 NMJ bouton arbor. Presynaptic bouton membranes are labeled by anti-HRP antibody (magenta). The microtubule network has a complex structure and extends into the terminal boutons (arrowheads and inset). Many proximal boutons have loops (arrows). Microtubules are also observed outside of the boundaries of the NMJ; these are within the muscle fiber, which also expresses α-tubulin. Staining of these muscle microtubules is minimized by the use of Bouin's fix.(B) In spastin5.75 mutants, the microtubule network is much sparser than in controls, particularly in the distal boutons at the edges of the bouton clumps that are characteristic of spastin mutant NMJs (arrowheads and inset). Many of these distal boutons have little or no detectable α-tubulin staining. More proximal boutons still have tubulin loops, however (arrows).Scale bar, 5 μm.\n",

To increase specificity, 320 sequences were removed because they were also highly expressed in one or more non-lymphoid tissues, as described in the text. The pattern of expression of the remaining 360 \"immune genes\" across tissues is shown. (B) Hierarchical tree clustering of 360 immune genes across 18 normal adult and fetal tissues. There are 3 major groups of tissues that show clusters of highly expressed \"immune genes\" These include the 6 immune tissues, various segments of adult intestine, and fetal day 16.5 lung and intestine. Less prominent clusters are seen in adult lung and liver. Genes in these clusters are described in the text. While the band of high expression extends across all genes for the 6 immune tissues, relative expression of each gene within the immune tissues shows distinct patterning.\n",

The first codon of each module (ggn) determined the \"linking\" amino acid glycine. (C) Single modules were connected resulting in controlled assembly of synthetic genes. To study different length repeat units, one or two Q modules were combined with one A module to obtain (AQ) or (QAQ). These repeat units were multimerized to generate synthetic genes coding for the repetitive proteins (rep-proteins) (AQ)n and (QAQ)n. The repetitive part of ADF-4 is generally composed of a single consensus module termed C, which was multimerized to obtain the rep-protein Cn.

Mismatch errors (43 of them, i.e., 0.3%, during growth at Gmc = 17, Gse = 8.6) characteristically terminate the Sierpinski pattern at corners.

Backward growth is non-deterministic: at sites where both binding domains agree (e.g., green arrows), there are two possible tiles that can make two bonds (either {T-10, T-01}, or {T-00, T-11}). At sites where the available binding domains disagree (e.g., red arrows), there is no tile that can associate to form two bonds.

In L4 and adult hermaphrodites the activity of fog-2 and gld-1 are low, leading to high tra-2 activity and the repression of fem-3, resulting in oogenesis.

Progressive C-terminal deletions (black) in FOG-2 were generated to identify FOG-2 requirements for GLD-1 interaction. Binding to GLD-1 was completely eliminated with the removal of the C-terminal 64 aa of FOG-2 exon 4.

      " Misexpression of Snail in Mouse Skin Epidermis Results in HyperproliferationThree different surviving Tg founder mice harbored a K14-Snail transgene that was integrated into a locus that resulted in inheritable, mosaic expression of the transgene in skin epidermis. All displayed similar abnormalities, as did their offspring.(A) P16 WT and K14-Snail Tg mice. Insets denote magnified tail segments, which displayed a mosaic, flaky appearance in Tg mice. Size differences appeared with age, and are likely due to K14-promoter activity in the tongue and oral epithelium, resulting in progressive defects and reduced food intake. Hence, skin sections from young (P3) mice were analyzed (B–I).(B) Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained Tg skin section. Double arrows demarcate the border of mosaic histology, with seemingly normal epidermis (epi) and a mature hair follicle (hf) at left and hyperthickened epidermis at right.(C) Immunofluorescence of Tg skin section labeled with antibodies as color-coded on frame. Double arrows demarcate the border of mosaic anti-Snail (green), revealing Snail expression coincident with regions of hyperthickened epidermis (at left) and absent in regions of normal epidermis (at right).(D–I) Sections of P3 WT or Tg skin (affected region) subjected to either immunofluorescence (D, E, H, and I) or immunohistochemistry (F and G) with antibodies as indicated on the panel. Anti-keratin 5 indicates K5, normally restricted to the basal layer of the epidermis; anti-keratin 6 detects keratin 6, expressed in postnatal epidermis under conditions such as wounding, in which hyperproliferation occurs. All other antibodies are as in the legend to Figure 2. Comparison of D and E provide representative examples that illustrate that pMAPK is found in only a subset of all proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells. Note also the presence of Ki67- (E) and pMAPK-positive (G) cells in some suprabasal areas; Ki67-positive cells colabeled with anti-Snail (E).\n",

      " Snail-Mediated Remodeling of AJs Contributes to Hyperproliferation(A) Immunofluorescence of skin sections from P30 Wt and Tg mice. Shown are affected areas of Tg skin; in areas where Snail protein was not expressed, stainings were normal. Antibodies used are against AJ proteins and include E-cadherin (E-cad), the transmembrane core protein; β-catenin (β-cat), which binds E-cadherin at AJs and which can also participate as a transcription cofactor when associated with LEF-1/TCF proteins in the nucleus; α-catenin (α-cat) which binds to both β-catenin and Ajuba, a close relative of zyxin; and Ajuba, which can associate with proteins that bind to the actin cytoskeleton, as well as with Grb-2, a mediator of the GTP nucleotide-exchange protein Sos, involved in activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade. In Snail-expressing Tg regions, there was a reduced staining with anti-E-cad and anti-α-cat and a more diffuse staining with anti-Ajuba. Insets in the panels for β-catenin and Ajuba staining are magnified views of the boxed areas. Arrows mark membrane localization of the protein and asterisks mark cells with elevated levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin or Ajuba.(B) Western blot analyses of protein extracts from P30 Wt and Tg back and ear skins. Antibodies are as in (A) except anti-P-cad, which detects P-cadherin, whose expression in the hair follicle was not affected, and anti-tubulin, which detects tubulin, a control for equal protein loadings. Note that the reductions seen in E-cadherin and α-catenin are likely to be underestimates of the actual differences in affected regions, since the Tg skin expressed Snail mosaically.(C) In the presence of elevated Snail, α-catenin levels can be restored by overexpression of E-cadherin. Keratinocytes were transfected with either HA-tagged Snail (Snail[HA]; images on the left) or Snail(HA) and Ecad(HA) (images on the right). 2 d after transfection, cells were switched from low-calcium growth medium to high-calcium medium for 6 h to induce AJ formation. Cells were stained with antibodies as indicated on the panels. Arrowheads point to sites of intercellular contact between a Snail-transfected keratinocyte and its neighboring untransfected cell.(D) Reintroduction of E-cadherin in keratinocytes expressing Snail returns pMAPK to basal levels. Keratinocytes were transfected with control vector (K14), or Snail(HA), or Snail(HA) + E-cad(HA). After 2 d, cells were serum starved for 4 h and whole cell lysates were made and Western blotted with antibodies to pMAPK, HA to recognize the HA-tagged Snail and E-cadherin protein, 20or tubulin as a loading control.(E) Ajuba interacts with Grb-2 under conditions where α-catenin levels are reduced. Protein extracts were made from skins of P30 Wt and K14-Snail Tg P30 mice (blots on the left) and of newborn Wt and K14-Cre/α-catenin (fl/fl) conditionally null animals (blots on the right) [7]. Equal amounts of protein extracts were treated with anti-Grb-2 antibody (+) or control isotype antibody (–), and following centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-Ajuba and anti-Grb-2 antibodies. Note the presence of Ajuba only under conditions where levels of α-catenin and other AJ proteins were aberrantly low or absent.(F) Transgene expression of excess Ajuba or the Grb-2-interacting domain (pre-LIM) of Ajuba in keratinocytes results in the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Primary newborn mouse keratinocytes were transfected with either the empty K14 expression vector (K14), or the expression vector driving Snail, full length Ajuba, or the pre-LIM domain of Ajuba in the absence or presence of a peptide inhibitor (inh) that disrupts the interaction between Grb-2 and Sos. 48 h posttransfection, protein extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with antibodies against pMAPK, total MAPK, Ajuba (also recognizing the smaller, pre-LIM domain), and Snail.\n",

      " TGF-β2, but Not Wnt/noggin, Transiently Induces Snail Expression In Vitro(A) Failure of Wnt and noggin signaling to induce Snail in cultured keratinocytes. Primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with Wnt- and/or noggin-conditioned medium (+) or the corresponding control medium (–). These conditions are known to activate the LEF-1/β-catenin reporter TOPGal and down-regulate the E-cadherin promoter (see [4] for details). Using Western blot analyses, cellular proteins were then analyzed for Snail, LEF-1, β-catenin, and tubulin. Proteins from keratinocytes transfected with K14-Snail were used as a positive control for Snail expression.(B) TGF-β2 can induce Snail protein. Primary keratinocytes were treated for the indicated times with recombinant TGF-β2 (+) or heat inactivated TGF-β2 (–).Total cellular proteins were then isolated and analyzed by Western blot for Snail, pSMAD2 (reflective of activated TGF- signaling), and tubulin. Note the activation of Snail expression, peaking at 2 h post-TGF-β2 treatment and then disappearing thereafter.(C) Snail mRNA expression is transiently induced by TGF-β2. The experiment in (B) was repeated, and this time, total RNAs were isolated from keratinocytes treated with TGF-β2 for the indicated times. RT-PCR was then used with (+) or without (–) reverse transcriptase (RT) and with primer sets specific for Snail and GAPDH mRNAs. Note that Snail mRNA expression also peaked at 2 h, paralleling Snail protein.(D) TGF-β2 treatment results in enhanced activity of a Snail promoter-β-galactosidase reporter. Keratinocytes were transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter driven by a Snail promoter that is either WT (wt prom) or harbors a mutation in a putative pSMAD2/pSMAD4 binding site (mt prom). At 2 d posttransfection, cells were treated with either TGF-β or heat-inactivated TGF-β2 (inact) for the times indicated. β-galactosidase assays were then conducted, and results are reported as fold increase over a basal level of activity of 1. The experiment was repeated three times in triplicate, and error bars reflect variations in the results.\n",

      " Comparison between the intimal thickening of the LAD (A) and the middle cerebral artery (B) of the same 18-year old subject. In the latter artery the intimal thickening is minimal in contrast to that of LAD which is circumferential with a thickness greater than tunica media. C), difference in maximal thickness in microns found in main coronary arteries and branches in respect of the middle cerebral artery. D), absence of intimal thickening in the LAD of dogs, despite and identical morpho-function. This suggests a possible role of the neurogenic control of coronary arteries in humans. On the other hand the absence of intimal thickening in the \"mural tract\" of coronary arterial vessels (E) emphasizes the role of systolic dynamic stresses on arterial wall free to expande versus those protected by encircling contracted myocardium.\n",

      " Natural history of the coronary atherosclerotic plaque in general population, including most of CHD patients. The starting point is a nodular hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue with progressive fibrous replacement. No other changes as subendothelial lipo-protein-cholesterol storage, inflammatory process of any type, platelet aggregation and/or fibrin-platelet thrombi are found (A). Proteoglycan accumulation in the deep intima between tunica media and the fibrous cap is the second step (B). In this proteoglycan pool, lipo-protein/cholesterol cleft, in macrophages (\"foam cells\") and/or Ca++ salts appear. Vascularization of the plaque and hemorrhage (C) follow. In the stage of proteoglycan accumulation, lympho-plasmacellular infiltrates occur in the adventitia and intima (C) with specific localization, around adventitial nerves closed to the tunica media (medial neuritis) (D, E). This natural history is totally different from that obtained experimentally by hypercholesterol diet in animals free of spontaneous atherosclerosis or in the small group of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (F), in which transendothelial lipo-protein insudation is the starting point.\n",

Spike times obtained from a single receptor neuron with four different peak intensities (83–86 dB SPL) are shown for 30 runs each. For the different intensities, both click amplitudes were varied while their ratio was kept fixed, with intensity values referring to the larger click amplitude. The inter-click interval in this example was 40 μs. The values of p denote the measured spike probabilities. The inset displays spike times from the strongest sound stimulus at higher magnification. All spikes fall in a temporal window between 4.5 and 5.5 ms after stimulation. Spike times were recorded with a temporal resolution of 0.1 ms. These data illustrate that the response of the receptor cell is well described by the occurrence probability of a single spike in a rather broad time window, for example, between 3 and 10 ms after stimulus presentation.

Note that in (B) the overall sensitivity of the neuron seems to have changed; the intersections of the straight line and the circle with the x- and y-axis do not match exactly although the stimulus in these cases is the same, a single click. The reason may be either a slow adaptation process or a slight rundown of the recording over the experimental time of around 30 min.

Oxidation of deuterated methanol (CD3OD) leads to the production of formaldehyde with two deuteriums (CD2O). Direct condensation with H4F (green arrows) and conversion to serine via the serine cycle (Figure 1) generates serine with two deuteriums. Alternatively, methylene-H4F may be produced through the long route (blue arrows; Figure 1), generating serine containing only one of the original deuteriums. Extraction and derivatizion of small molecules for analysis by GC–MS provides the ratio of (+1)/(+2) serine isotopomers, thereby assaying the proportion of methylene-H4F generated via the long route through formate or from the direct route from formaldehyde.(B) Detection of serine by GC–MS.

The representative recordings shown are for propofol effects at 10 minutes following exposure to anesthetic (i.e. at 30 min on the x axis for the grouped data) and after 30 minutes of exposure, when a nearly complete block of the population spike was apparent. (C) Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) were also depressed by halothane and this effect was not reversed by BIC, indicating a direct effect of the anesthetic on glutamate-mediated synapses. (D) Propofol-induced depression of glutamate-mediated EPSPs, in contrast, appeared to involve enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition, since this depression was completely reversed by BIC. The two anesthetics exhibited quite different sensitivities to reversal by BIC, indicating that actions at GABA synapses vary for these agents. For each graph, data were normalized and each point represents the mean ± SD for at least five measures from different slices made from separate animals. Horizontal bars indicate the time of exposure to each drug. Sample recordings from representative experiments are shown in the top traces. (E) BIC reversal of anesthetic-induced population spike depression was agent specific for equieffective levels of depression, and data are summarized for four anesthetics as bar graphs. Shaded bars represent the degree of depression produced by each anesthetic and open bars show the extent of reversal produced by BIC, error bars indicate SD for at least five measures from different slices. Volatile agents (isoflurane – ISO, 350 μM; halothane – HAL, 250 μM) were only weakly reversed by BIC, while intravenous agents (pentobarbital – PEN, 400 μM; thiopental – THIO, 80 μM; propofol-PRO, 30 μM) were more sensitive to the GABA receptor antagonist. (F) A similar profile of agent specific effects for BIC reversal was evident for glutamate-mediated EPSP responses, volatile agent effects were poorly reversed while intravenous agents appeared to be more sensitive to the GABA antagonist.\n",

      " Whole cell patch clamp recordings of spontaneous GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in CA1 neurons revealed two sites of action for anesthetic-induced enhanced inhibition. (A) Spontaneous synaptic currents were blocked by a GABAA-receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC), indicating that they were GABAA-mediated Cl- currents. Traces on the top show 20 s of continuous recording from a CA1 neuron in control and in the presence of BIC. A rate meter graph (bottom) shows the relatively stable frequency of IPSCs during 20 min of control recording, followed by a rapid and complete block of responses produced by BIC (indicated by the bar). (B) Halothane produced a marked increase of the inhibitory charge transfer in CA1 neurons measured as the integral of current recordings (shaded area in top traces). A three fold increase of inhibitory charge (pico Colombs – pC) was reversibly produced by halothane and appeared to come about through both a prolongation of IPSC time course (C) and from an increased frequency of synaptic currents (D). Both effects persisted in the presence of 10 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and/or glutamate receptor antagonists indicating that action potential dependent activity and glutamate synapses were not required for anesthetic action. For the rate meter histograms in (A) and (D), each bin represents the number of events recorded in 4 s divided by 4 to give a frequency in Hz (events/second). For all IPSC recordings a CsCl based internal solution was used in the patch pipette.\n",

      " Anesthetics act at several sites to depress CA1 neuron synaptically evoked discharge. (A) Halothane appears to act presynaptically to depress glutamate release, evidenced by an increase in paired pulse facilitation concomitant with EPSP depression. A similar increase in facilitation was produced by isoflurane and pentobarbital, but not by thiopental or propofol. No change in EPSP rise or decay time was apparent in the presence any anesthetic. (B) The increased facilitation produced by halothane, isoflurane and pentobarbital was not reversed by bicuculline (BIC) indicating a depressant effect on glutamate nerve terminals – independent of anesthetic effects at GABAA receptors. (C) Differential GABA effects were also evident for paired pulse inhibition of population spike responses. Volatile agents like halothane produced little or no paired pulse inhibition at concentrations that produced a half maximal depression of first pulse responses. In contrast, propofol increased paired pulse inhibition and similar effects were observed with thiopental and pentobarbital. This increase in paired pulse inhibition was reversed by bicuculline indicating that these anesthetics enhanced recurrent GABAA-mediated inhibition. (D) The anesthetics also appeared to act directly on CA1 pyramidal neuron membrane excitability to slow action potential discharge activity, although the intravenous agents were much more effective compared to volatile anesthetics. None of the anesthetics produced an appreciable effect on individual action potential amplitude or time course (right: control – solid line; anesthetic – dotted, for halothane on top and propofol on bottom). (E) Anesthetics act at multiple sites to depress the CA1 neuron circuit. Sites of action are indicated on a diagram of CA1 circuitry showing input from Schaffer-collateral fibers, local inhibitory interneurons (IN) and a CA1 pyramidal neuron (triangle). Action potential propagation in Schaffer-collateral fibers (1) was depressed by ~ 15% by halothane and this contributes about 25 % to EPSP depression [60, 61]; see also [17]. This effect did not contribute to anesthetic-induced increases in facilitation, because no change in facilitation occurred when a comparable amount of action potential depression was produced by tetrodotoxin [61]. Further presynaptic depression at glutamate nerve terminals (2) was evident from the increased facilitation observed (Fig. 3A&3B) and there is also good evidence for postsynaptic depressant effects on both NMDA and AMPA receptors (3) [16, 19, 62, 63]. Anesthetics also act pre- and postsynaptically at GABA-mediated synapses (4, see Fig. 2) and can also increase tonic GABA-mediated inhibition by acting as GABA agonists in the absence of synaptically released GABA (5) [46-48]. Perisynaptic and extrasynaptic tonic GABAA receptors (7) also contribute to the postsynaptic depression produced by isoflurane [64] as well as thiopental and propofol [4, 65]. Enhanced recurrent inhibition (6) plays and important role for anesthetics in vivo [45] and strong effects were evident in the present study for propofol, thiopental and pentobarbital (Fig. 3C), similar to effects previously reported for halothane in hippocampal slices [26]. In addition, anesthetics also directly depress CA1 neuron excitability by blocking calcium channels and enhancing potassium currents contributing to hyperpolarization (8) and increased discharge thresholds [40, 41, 42, also Nishikawa, Beida & Maclver, unpublished]. These latter effects could influence CA1 neuron discharge activity for near threshold responses, but for the stronger stimuli used in the present study, effects on GABA and glutamate synapses and on postsynaptic receptors for these transmitters appear to contribute most (~ 80 %) to the depressant actions observed.\n",

      " Effective information, minimum information bipartition, and complexes. a. Effective information. Shown is a single subset S of 4 elements ({1,2,3,4}, blue circle), forming part of a larger system X (black ellipse). This subset is bisected into A and B by a bipartition ({1,3}/{2,4}, indicated by the dotted grey line). Arrows indicate causally effective connections linking A to B and B to A across the bipartition (other connections may link both A and B to the rest of the system X). To measure EI(A→B), maximum entropy Hmax is injected into the outgoing connections from A (corresponding to independent noise sources). The entropy of the states of B that is due to the input from A is then measured. Note that A can affect B directly through connections linking the two subsets, as well as indirectly via X. Applying maximum entropy to B allows one to measure EI(B→A). The effective information for this bipartition is EI(A  B) = EI(A→B) + EI(B→A). b. Minimum information bipartition. For subset S = {1,2,3,4}, the horizontal bipartition {1,3}/{2,4} yields a positive value of EI. However, the bipartition {1,2}/{3,4} yields EI = 0 and is a minimum information bipartition (MIB) for this subset. The other bipartitions of subset S = {1,2,3,4} are {1,4}/{2,3}, {1}/{2,3,4}, {2}/{1,3,4}, {3}/{1,2,4}, {4}/{1,2,3}, all with EI>0. c. Analysis of complexes. By considering all subsets of system X one can identify its complexes and rank them by the respective values of Φ – the value of EI for their minimum information bipartition. Assuming that other elements in X are disconnected, it is easy to see that Φ>0 for subset {3,4} and {1,2}, but Φ = 0 for subsets {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, and {1,2,3,4}. Subsets {3,4} and {1,2} are not part of a larger subset having higher Φ, and therefore they constitute complexes. This is indicated schematically by having them encircled by a grey oval (darker grey indicates higher Φ). Methodological note. In order to identify complexes and their Φ(S) for systems with many different connection patterns, each system X was implemented as a stationary multidimensional Gaussian process such that values for effective information could be obtained analytically (details in [8]). Briefly, in order to identify complexes and their Φ(S) for systems with many different connection patterns, we implemented numerous model systems X composed of n neural elements with connections CONij specified by a connection matrix CON(X) (no self-connections). In order to compare different architectures, CON(X) was normalized so that the absolute value of the sum of the afferent synaptic weights per element corresponded to a constant value w<1 (here w = 0.5). If the system's dynamics corresponds to a multivariate Gaussian random process, its covariance matrix COV(X) can be derived analytically. As in previous work, we consider the vector X of random variables that represents the activity of the elements of X, subject to independent Gaussian noise R of magnitude c. We have that, when the elements settle under stationary conditions, X = X * CON(X) + cR. By defining Q = (1-CON(X))-1 and averaging over the states produced by successive values of R, we obtain the covariance matrix COV(X) = <X*X> = <Qt * Rt * R * Q> = Qt * Q, where the superscript t refers to the transpose. Under Gaussian assumptions, all deviations from independence among the two complementary parts A and B of a subset S of X are expressed by the covariances among the respective elements. Given these covariances, values for the individual entropies H(A) and H(B), as well as for the joint entropy of the subset H(S) = H(AB) can be obtained as, for example, H(A) = (1/2)ln [(2π e)n|COV(A)|], where |•| denotes the determinant. The mutual information between A and B is then given by MI(A;B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(AB). Note that MI(A:B) is symmetric and positive. To obtain the effective information between A and B within model systems, independent noise sources in A are enforced by setting to zero strength the connections within A and afferent to A. Then the covariance matrix for A is equal to the identity matrix (given independent Gaussian noise), and any statistical dependence between A and B must be due to the causal effects of A on B, mediated by the efferent connections of A. Moreover, all possible outputs from A that could affect B are evaluated. Under these conditions, EI(A→B) = MI(AHmax;B). The independent Gaussian noise R applied to A is multiplied by cp, the perturbation coefficient, while the independent Gaussian noise applied to the rest of the system is given by ci, the intrinsic noise coefficient. Here cp = 1 and ci = 0.00001 in order to emphasize the role of the connectivity and minimize that of noise. To identify complexes and obtain their capacity for information integration, one considers every subset S of X composed of k elements, with k = 2,..., n. For each subset S, we consider all bipartitions and calculate EI(A  B) for each of them. We find the minimum information bipartition MIB(S), the bipartition for which the normalized effective information reaches a minimum, and the corresponding value of Φ(S). We then find the complexes of X as those subsets S with Φ>0 that are not included within a subset having higher Φ and rank them based on their Φ(S) value. The complex with the maximum value of Φ(S) is the main complex. MATLAB functions used for calculating effective information and complexes are at .\n",

      " Leukemogenic Effects of PML-RARá and Mechanisms of ATRA/Arsenic Trioxide in the Treatment of APL(A) In the absence of RA, RARα/RXR heterodimers recruit the transcription corepressor (CoR), which mediates transcriptional silencing by mechanisms that include direct inhibition of the basal transcription machinery and recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Chromatin modification includes histone deacetylation, which leads to a compact chromatin structure that impairs the access of transcriptional activators. In the presence of physiological concentrations (10−9–10−8 M) of RA, the transcription corepressor is released and the coactivator is recruited to the RARα/RXR heterodimer, resulting in histone acetylation (AC) and overcoming of the transcription blockage.(B) PML-RARα fusion protein binds to RARα target genes either on its own or with RXR and then recruits corepressors, leading to transcriptional repression and myeloid differentiation inhibition. PML-RARα oncoprotein sequesters the normal RXR and PML, inhibits the PML/P53 apoptotic pathway, and delocalizes PML and other proteins from the nuclear body. PML-RARα also may affect interferon (IFN) and other signal pathways. Abnormalities in protein tyrosine kinases (e.g., FLT3, c-fms) may collaborate with PML-RARα to cause APL.(C) In the presence of pharmacological doses of ATRA or arsenic trioxide, the PML-RARα fusion is degraded in ways that are dependent on caspases and proteasomes. The degradation of PML-RARα may lead to derepression of transcription suppression and restoration of PML nuclear body structure. The blockade of other signaling pathways is also released, and the anti-apoptotic effect of PML-RARα is lost. ATRA also induces cyclic AMP (cAMP), which reverses the silencing of RXR, induces the expression of RA-induced genes and cyclooxygenase 1 (Cox 1), inhibits angiogenesis, and downregulates tissue factor. Subsequently, ATRA induces terminal cell differentiation, while arsenic trioxide induces partial differentiation and/or apoptosis of APL cells.

      " Effects of the Different Manipulations on the Mean and Dispersion of RT(A) Changes in the mean RT of the numeric task when it comes first in the different experimental manipulations. Changing the notation or the response complexity makes mean RT slower, and within each condition, responses are slower for close than for far distances. The difference between far and close conditions is independent of the experimental manipulation, indicating an additive effect that is tested in the ANOVAs (see Table 2).(B) A different pattern is observed for the interquartile range, which provides a measure of dispersion. While distance manipulation results in a major change of the interquartile range, there is not a major effect of notation or response complexity.\n",

      " Description of the Task and Sketch of the PRP Model and Its Predictions(A) Scheme of the main PRP effect. The vertical axis labels RT. The column on the left indicates the first task, and each coloured box within the column represents a different stage of processing: P component (dark green), C component (red), and M component (blue). The series of columns on the right indicate the processing time for task 2 at different delays (Δ), labelled on the x-axis. For each column, the three different boxes represent the three different stages of task 2: P component (green), C component (orange), and M component (cyan). As Δ progresses, the P component starts later. All components can be performed in parallel except for the C component, which establishes a bottleneck. This results in the following predictions: (1) response to the first task is independent of Δ, and (2) the RT2 (from onset of the trial) represented by the black line, is unchanged for small Δ while at sufficiently large Δ (noninterference regime) it increases linearly, with a slope of one, with Δ.(B) The predicted RT1 and RT2 (from trial onset) as a function of Δ is represented by the grey and black lines, respectively.(C) The model also establishes definite predictions for experiments in which one of the tasks is changed. The six different panels indicate all possible manipulations: first task changed (left column) or second task changed (right column) and whether the change affects the P component (first row), C component (middle row), or M component (bottom row). The changed component is labelled with a highlighted box and with an arrow. For simplicity, we assumed that the task manipulation always increases the duration of one component. RTs before the manipulation (which are the same across all panels) are represented with a solid line, grey for RT1 and black for RT2, and the RTs of the manipulated task are labelled with a dotted line with the same colour code. If the first task is changed (left column), different effects are observed depending on whether the change is in the M component or in the P–C components (which cannot be distinguished with this manipulation). If the M component is affected (bottom row), RT1 changes, but the response to the second task is unchanged. If the locus of the change is in either the P or the C component (middle and top rows), there is a larger delay until execution of task 2 and the following effect is observed: for small Δ (interference regime), RTs are increased and the regime of interference is increased, which is indicated by a shift of the kink to the right. If the second task is changed (right column), different effects are observed depending on whether the change is in the P component or in either the C or M component. If the change is in the P component (top row), for small Δ there is no net change in the response to the second task (because there was a wait at the end of the P component so extending it does not change total time execution), but there is less wait and thus the kink is shifted to the left. If the change is made in either the C or M component (middle and bottom rows) the result is a rigid shift, which is independent of Δ. By performing experiments in which the two tasks are presented in different orders, all task components can be differentiated. All task manipulations, according to the PRP model, should fall into one of the three categories, perceptual, central, or motor, each defined by its characteristic RT signature.\n",

The effect of both notation and response appears to be a shift of the distribution to the right while the distance effect is a change in the slope.

The integration time decreases with distance, but it is independent of the tasks. In contrast, the fixed delay does not change with distance but changes with the task. The summed delay plus integration time fit the mean reaction times for each distance (solid circles).(D) Statistics performed on the fit reveal that the fixed delay has a slope not significantly different from zero (i.e., it does not depend on distance), but it changes with task. In contrast, the integration time is significantly different from zero, but it does not change with task.\n",

      " Coupled Waves of ATP Hydrolysis in RecA Filaments(A) The interval between hydrolyzing monomers (i) is set at four monomers. The dark monomers are those at the hydrolytic step of their ATP hydrolytic cycle. Each monomer within the filament (e.g., the one marked with an “X”) is hydrolyzing an ATP every 3 s, so that a new wave must reach it within that time span. If i = 4 monomers, the waves must move every 0.75 s. The last wave, at the disassembling end, results in dissociation.(B) The same considerations in (A) for i = 4 monomers are illustrated for i = 6 monomers.\n",

      " Model for RecA Filament Disassembly from Linear ssDNA(A) In the model, end-dependent disassembly occurs, with SSB filling in the vacated DNA. At low frequency, additional RecA monomers nucleate filament formation on the vacated DNA, and the new filament (dark ovals) extends until it catches up with the original filament (open ovals). This creates a new disassembling end.(B) Kinetics of disassembly as monitored by DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. This curve is an approximation of curves reported in previous work [27]. The rate of ATP hydrolysis declines as RecA protein dissociates from the ssDNA, until a lower steady-state rate is reached. The steady state reflects a balance between disassembly and new filament formation.(C) If, upon rebinding, the new filament does match the old one in phase, the junction between the old and new filaments could be a site of RecA monomer exchange with the solution. There will be no net disassembly at this point and no resulting change in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, because any monomers that dissociate will be immediately replaced by extension of the trailing filament.\n",

      " Schematic illustration depicting the spatiotemporal pattern of axon degeneration after cut and crush injury of a wild-type and a WldS peripheral nerve. Each yellow line represents an individual YFP positive axon in wild-type (A, B) and WldS (C, D) peripheral nerves. Accounting for wild-type peripheral nerves, firstly, both after transection (A) and crush injury (B) axonal fragmentation progresses as a localised wave quickly within a matter of few hours over the individual axon. Thereby, the abrupt shift between preserved and fragmented axon distances along partially fragmented axons represents the wave front. The processes differ only in direction with an anterograde course after cut and a retrograde course after crush lesion. Secondly, axonal fragmentation in the YFP positive axon population is asynchronous with some intact and others entirely or partially fragmented in one nerve at one time point. Thirdly, axonal breaks are dispersed homogenously along totally fragmented fibres. In contrast, in WldS peripheral nerves, firstly, both after transection (C) and crush (D) injury axonal degeneration progresses in anterograde direction with a velocity similar to that of slow axonal transport. Secondly, the gradients of axon degeneration are uniform with gradual decrease of degenerative changes along the axon from proximal to distal. Thirdly, degeneration happens broadly synchronously among the population of WldS axons. Fourthly, formation of end bulbs with subsequent swellings at the proximal ends of WldS axons can be observed especially after crush lesion but also occasionally after transection lesion.\n",

Differences in the number of protected axons between the proximal and distal end of the stump were maximum after 20 days and more moderate prior or later to that, correspondingly. Remarkably, after 30 days following crush lesion considerable numbers of totally intact axons could be counted (63.5 % in distal tibial nerve) pointing to a weaker effect of compression over transection and generally to the longevity of distal WldS axons. B-E: Light microscopic images (B, D) and corresponding electron micrographs (C, E) taken from the proximal (B, C) and distal (D, E) end of the peripheral nerve stump after 20 days following transection lesion.

      " Two models to account for the progressive nature of Wallerian degeneration after transection lesions in wild-type axons. (A) A putative inhibitor of intrinsic self-destruction machinery is constantly delivered from the cell body to the unlesioned wild-type axon (top). After axon transection the inhibitor is no longer supplied and is cleared first from proximal regions of the distal stump by fast axonal transport. This leads to a wave of fragmentation moving proximal to distal along the isolated axon stump. (B) In an alternative model, the wave of fragmentation is propagated not by directional removal of a putative inhibitor but by rapid localised influx of calcium ions beginning at the most vulnerable part of the axon. Once inside, calcium ions not only activate calpains to degrade the local axoplasm, but also diffuse and exceed the threshold of calpain activation in the immediately adjacent region. This leads to further axoplasmic and membrane breakdown and further calcium influx. The pattern is repeated to generate a wave of fragmentation moving along the axon. Model (A) has the attraction that the putative inhibitor would be a good candidate for mediating of the WldS phenotype (e.g., it could be overexpressed in WldS), while model (B) more easily explains why the directionality is reversed in a crush lesion. The calcium influx and diffusion wave could spread also retrogradely (not shown) if the distal end were the first to disintegrate. In model (A), however, it is hard to see how retrograde axonal transport could explain the depletion of an inhibitor that ultimately has to come from the cell body (see text for more details).\n",

      " Apoptosis mediated by death receptors requires the FADD adaptor molecule. (A) Engagement of a Fas ligand trimer on a trimer of Fas leads to FADD adaptor molecule recruitment through homotypic DD interactions. FADD next binds initiator pro-caspase through DED interactions. This Fas/FADD/pro-caspase complex forms the Fas death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) since initiator pro-caspase activates a caspase cascade resulting in apoptotic death of the cell. Alternatively, c-FLIPs can promote cell survival by interacting with FADD through their respective DED, thus hindering recruitment and activation of initiator pro-caspase. (B) Signaling mediated by TNF-R1 implicates formation of two sequential complexes [61]. The complex I (in blue) contains the TNF-R1, the adaptor TRADD, the receptor interacting kinase (RIP), and the TNF-receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2). It assemblies rapidly following TNF-α stimulation and activates the NF-kB pathway which in turn induces expression of survival genes, including c-FLIP. Later on, complex I dissociates from the TNF-R1 and is internalized. FADD can then bind the liberated DD of TRADD and recruits initiator pro-caspase, forming complex II (in red) which is cytoplasmic. Activation of initiator pro-caspase 8/10 in complex II results in apoptosis of the cell. Red box: DD; hatched red box: DED.\n",

      " Lack of FADD expression confers survival/growth advantages on tumor cells. Absence of FADD protein confers multiple death receptor-mediated apoptosis resistance and allows tumor cells to co-express death receptors and ligands without committing cell death. (A) Lack of FADD contributes to immune escape and resistance to chemotherapy. FADD deficient tumor cells resist death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by TIL and chemotherapeutic drugs. Anthracyclines increase Fas and FasL expression on tumor cells. Etoposide induces Fas receptor trimerization, leading to Fas-mediated cell death independently of FasL expression. Both drugs enhance TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis. (B) Lack of FADD contributes to tumor counter-attack. Lack of FADD expression allows many types of tumor cells to express innocuously functional FasL that can kill TIL. Secretion of TNF-α by AML cells can have cytotoxic effects on TIL. (C) Lack of FADD contributes to tumor growth. In the absence of FADD, Fas signaling leads to a proliferative signal instead of an apoptotic one. Concomitant death receptor and ligand expression, in the absence of FADD, allows autocrine (in red) and paracrine (in orange) proliferation of tumor cells. Activated TIL can contribute to paracrine (in purple) proliferation of FADD-deficient tumor cells.\n",
